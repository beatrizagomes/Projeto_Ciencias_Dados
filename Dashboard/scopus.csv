The social disorganization theory proposes that neighbourhood scale characteristics, including ethnic composition and immigrant residents, indirectly influence crime through social control. Recent spatial demographic changes in urban areas, including increased immigration and ethnic heterogeneity in city peripheries, have motivated reconsiderations of social disorganization. Using exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial regression methods, this research identifies violent crime hotspots and analyzes the influence of ethnic composition and immigrant resident concentration on violent crime in Toronto, Ontario, at the census tract scale. Results suggest that violent crime hotspots are located in downtown and north Toronto and that ethnic heterogeneity is positively associated with violent crime rate while immigrant resident concentration is negatively associated. This research provides novel insight into the spatial dimensions of crime and the effects of spatial demographic changes on violent crime and social disorganization in contemporary cities. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Demography;

Starting in developed countries, population aging has now become a distinctive demographic phenomenon in developing countries. Nowadays developing countries have become the home to the largest proportion of older people in the world. This paper aimed to analyze the impact of population aging in Malaysia. Methods: We employed a secondary data analysis related to the impact of population aging in Malaysia. In analyzing the data, the paper detailed, segmented, coded and, formulated the text into themes through a thematic approach. The themes that emerged from the data were family changes, migration of youth, support and care, health problems, financial security as well as housing problems. These emerged themes mapped the shared patterns of the impacts of the population aging. Results: With the increasing of the older population in Malaysia, there are various impacts of population aging emerged, particularly in terms of family changes, youth migration to cities, support and care, health, financial security and housing. The discussion in this article is revolved around these impacts. Conclusion: The growth of older people and the impact emerging from it has certain policy implications for the government of the country. Thus, the government needs to prepare for adequate policies and resources for future older people. © 2021 Ismail et al.","Family support; Life expectancy; Older person; Population aging; Quality of life","adolescent;

In the context of the rapid development of big data technology, how to organically combine multi-source data, improve model accuracy, improve work efficiency and reduce work cost is a key issue in the construction of traffic generation analysis model. This paper integrates relevant data such as resident travel OD data, population migration data, and poi data. On the basis of the traditional traffic generation model, add the geographical advantage correction factor to establish a city area traffic generation analysis model based on multi-source big data. And take Heyuan City, Guangdong Province as an example for case analysis to demonstrate the validity and practicability of the model. The results show that the average absolute errors of traffic production and attraction in all traffic communities are 16.29% and 14.98% respectively.

Current tools available to monitor LF are limited to diagnostic tests targeting DNA repeats, filarial antigens, and anti-filarial antibodies. While these tools are useful for detection and surveillance, elimination programs have yet to take full advantage of molecular typing for inferring infection history, strain fingerprinting, and evolution. To date, molecular typing approaches have included whole mitochondrial genomes, genotyping, targeted sequencing, and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs). These studies have revealed much about Wb biology. For example, in one study in Papua New Guinea researchers identified 5 major strains that were widespread and many minor strains some of which exhibit geographic stratification. Genome data, while rare, has been utilized to reconstruct evolutionary relationships among taxa of the Onchocercidae (the clade of filarial nematodes) and identify gene synteny. Their phylogeny reveals that speciation from the common ancestor of both B. malayi and Wb occurred around 5-6. millions. years ago with shared ancestry to other filarial nematodes as recent as 15. million years ago. These discoveries hold promise for gene discovery and identifying drug targets in species that are more amenable to in vivo experiments. Continued technological developments in whole genome sequencing and data analysis will likely replace many other forms of molecular typing, multiplying the amount of data available on population structure, genetic diversity, and phylogenetics. Once widely available, the addition of population genetic data from genomic studies should hasten the elimination of LF parasites like Wb.Infectious disease control programs have benefited greatly from population genetics data and recently from population genomics data. However, while there is currently a surplus of data for diseases like malaria and HIV, there is a scarcity of this data for filarial nematodes. With the falling cost of genome sequencing, research on filarial nematodes could benefit from the addition of population genetics statistics and phylogenetics especially in dealing with elimination programs. A comprehensive review focusing on population genetics of filarial nematode does not yet exist.Here our goal is to provide a current overview of the molecular epidemiology of W. bancrofti (Wb) the primary causative agent of LF. We begin by reviewing studies utilizing molecular typing techniques with specific focus on genomic and population datasets. Next, we used whole mitochondrial genome data to construct a phylogeny and examine the evolutionary history of the Onchocercidae. Then, we provide a perspective to aid in understanding how population genetic techniques translate to modern epidemiology. Finally, we introduce the concept of genomic epidemiology and provide some examples that will aid in future studies of Wb. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Filariasis; Genetics; Genomics; Molecular epidemiology; Transmission; Wuchereria bancrofti","Animals; Elephantiasis, Filarial; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Variation; Humans; Molecular Epidemiology; Molecular Typing; Phylogeny; Prevalence; Wuchereria bancrofti; DNA; parasite antigen; antigen specificity; Brugia malayi; disease transmission; DNA determination; DNA sequence; gene flow; gene targeting; genetic strain; genetic variability; genotyping technique; human; immunoassay; last common ancestor; life history; lymphatic filariasis; microbial population dynamics; microscopy; migration; mitochondrial genome; molecular epidemiology; molecular evolution; molecular typing; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; parasite identification; parasite prevalence; phylogeny; population genetic structure; random amplified polymorphic DNA; Review; synteny; unindexed sequence; Wuchereria bancrofti; animal; classification; Elephantiasis, Filarial; genetics; molecular epidemiology; parasitology; prevalence; transmission; Wuchereria bancrofti","GENBANK: KC558603:KC558802, KC558803:KC558852","DNA, 9007-49-2","","","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (R01AI097262, R21AI103263, T32AI007024)","","Aliota M.T., Chen C.-C., Dagoro H., Fuchs J.F., Christensen B.M., Filarial worms reduce Plasmodium infectivity in mosquitoes, PLoS Negl.

However, less work has examined the role of short-term mobility in sexual partner concurrency using a network approach. Short-term mobility may be a risk for HIV for the migrant's partner as well either through the partner's risk behaviors while the migrant is away, such as the partner having additional partners, or via exposure to the return migrant.Methods:Using data from the 2010-11 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey, weighted generalized linear regression models were used to investigate the associations between short-term mobility and partnership concurrency at the individual and partnership levels.Results:At the individual level, we find strong evidence of an association between short-term mobility and concurrency. Men who traveled were more likely to have concurrent partnerships compared to men who did not travel and the relationship was non-linear: each trip was associated with a 2% higher probability of concurrency, with a diminishing risk at 60 trips (p<0.001). At the partnership level, short-term mobility by the male only or both partners was associated with male concurrency. Couples in which the female only traveled exhibited less male concurrency.Conclusions:Short-term mobility has the ability to impact population-level transmission dynamics by facilitating partnership concurrency and thus onward HIV transmission. Short-term migrants may be an important population to target for HIV testing, treatment, or social and behavioral interventions to prevent the spread of HIV. © 2013 Cassels et al.","","Adult; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Risk Factors; Sexual Partners; Travel; Zimbabwe; adult; article; concurrent sexual partnership; correlational study; data analysis; educational status; female; health survey; high risk behavior; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; population dynamics; population migration; sex difference; short term mobility; social status; statistical model; virus transmission; Zimbabwe; HIV Infections; risk factor; sexuality; transmission; travel","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, (R00 HD057533); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (P30AI027757); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R24HD042828)","","Brockerhoff M., Biddlecom A.E., Migration, Sexual behavior and the risk of HIV in Kenya, International Migration Review, 33, pp. 833-856, (1999); Lurie M.N., Williams B.G., Zuma K., Mkaya-Mwamburi D., Garnett G., Et al., The Impact of Migration on HIV-1 Transmission in South Africa: a Study of Migrant and Nonmigrant Men and their Partners, Sex Transm Dis, 30, pp. 149-156, (2003); Nunn A.J., Wagner H.U., Kamali A., Kengeya-Kayondo J.F., Mulder D.W., Migration and HIV-1 seroprevalence in a rural Ugandan population, AIDS, 9, pp. 503-506, (1995); Coffee M.P., Garnett G.P., Mlilo M., Voeten H., Chandiwana S., Et al., Patterns of movement and risk of HIV infection in rural Zimbabwe, Journal of Infectious Diseases, 191, (2005); Lagarde E., van der Loeff M.S., Enel C., Holmgren B., Dray-Spira R., Et al., Mobility and the spread of human immunodeficiency virus into rural areas of West Africa, Int J Epidemiol, 32, pp. 744-752, (2003); Lydie N., Robinson N.J., Ferry B., Akam E., De Loenzien M., Et al., Mobility, sexual behavior, and HIV infection in an urban population in Cameroon, J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 35, pp. 67-74, (2004); Quinn T.C., Population Migration And The Spread Of Type-1 And Type-2 Human Immunodeficiency Viruses, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 91, pp. 2407-2414, (1994); Zuma K., Lurie M.N., Williams B.G., Mkaya-Mwamburi D., Garnett G.P., Et al., Risk factors of sexually transmitted infections among migrant and non-migrant sexual partnerships from rural South Africa, Epidemiology And Infection, 133, pp. 421-428, (2005); Greif M.J., Dodoo F.N.A., Internal migration to Nairobi's slums: Linking migrant streams to sexual risk behavior, Health Place, 17, pp. 86-93, (2011); Deane K.D., Parkhurst J.O., Johnston D., Linking migration, mobility and HIV, Tropical Medicine & International Health, 15, pp. 1458-1463, (2010); Voeten H.A.C.M., Vissers D.C.J., Gregson S., Zaba B., White R.G., Et al., Strong Association Between In-Migration and HIV Prevalence in Urban Sub-Saharan Africa, Sex Transm Dis, 37, pp. 240-243, (2010); Mundandi C., Vissers D., Voeten H., Habbema D., Gregson S., No difference in HIV incidence and sexual behaviour between out-migrants and residents in rural Manicaland, Zimbabwe, Tropical Medicine & International Health, 11, pp. 705-711, (2006); Eaton J.W., Hallett T.B., Garnett G.P., Concurrent sexual partnerships and primary HIV infection: a critical interaction, AIDS Behav, 15, pp. 687-692, (2011); Goodreau S.M., Cassels S., Kasprzyk D., Montano D.E., Greek A., Et al., Concurrent Partnerships, Acute Infection and HIV Epidemic Dynamics Among Young Adults in Zimbabwe, AIDS Behav, 16, pp. 312-322, (2012); Mah T.L., Halperin D.T., Concurrent Sexual Partnerships and the HIV Epidemics in Africa: Evidence to Move Forward, AIDS and Behavior, 14, pp. 11-16, (2010); Morris M., Kurth A.E., Hamilton D.T., Moody J., Wakefield S., Et al., Concurrent partnerships and HIV prevalence disparities by race: Linking science and public health practice, American Journal of Public Health, 99, pp. 1023-1031, (2009); Carnegie N.B., Morris M., Size Matters: Concurrency and the Epidemic Potential of HIV in Small Networks, PLoS One, 7, (2012); Kishamawe C., Vissers D.C.J., Urassa M., Isingo R., Mwaluko G., Et al., Mobility and HIV in Tanzanian couples: both mobile persons and their partners show increased risk, AIDS, 20, pp. 601-608, (2006); Morris M., Kretzschmar M., Concurrent partnerships and the spread of HIV, AIDS, 11, pp. 641-648, (1997); Camlin C.S., Hosegood V., Newell M.L., McGrath N., Barnighausen T., Et al., Gender, migration and HIV in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, Plos One, 5, (2010); Lurie M.N., Williams B.G., Zuma K., Mkaya-Mwamburi D., Garnett G.P., Et al., Who infects whom?

Yet, especially in the modelling literature there is no consensus about how density-dependent emigration should quantitatively be incorporated into metapopulation models. In this paper we compare the performance of five different dispersal strategies (defined by the functional link between density and emigration probability). Four of these strategies are based on published functional relationships between local population density and emigration probability, one assumes density-independent dispersal. We use individual-based simulations of time-discrete metapopulation dynamics and conduct evolution experiments for a broad range of values for dispersal mortality and environmental stochasticity. For each set of these conditions we analyze the evolution of emigration rates in 'monoculture experiments' (with only one type of dispersal strategy used by all individuals in the metapopulation) as well as in selection experiments that allow a pair-wise comparison of the performance of each functional type. We find that a single-parameter 'asymptotic threshold' strategy - derived from the marginal value theorem - with a decelerating increase of emigration rate with increasing population density, out-competes any other strategy, i.e. density-independent emigration, a 'linear threshold' strategy and a flexible three-parameter strategy. Only when environmental conditions select for extremely high emigration probabilities (close to one), strategies may perform approximately equally. A simple threshold strategy derived for the case of continuous population growth performs even worse than the density-independent strategy. As the functional type of the dispersal function implemented in metapopulation models may severely affect predictions concerning the survival of populations, range expansion, or community changes we clearly recommend to carefully select adequate functions to model density-dependent dispersal. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

First, I highlight the conceptual problems related to the application of such theories to legislature-level data analysis. Next, I demonstrate the methodological and analytical problems that raise concerns about ad hoc theorizing in this field. Using counts of hostile and welcoming immigration legislation (2005–2011), I demonstrate that outgroup size measures correlate positively with both dependent variables while measures of population growth rate yield null results unless used on their own. These results suggest that the use of legislature-level models with demographic indicators does not allow us to gain a clear understanding of whether and how population dynamics influence immigration policymaking. Based on these findings, I recommend that when using demographic indicators as key explanatory variables, researchers provide evidence of result consistency across multiple model specifications and also test the models with both hostile and inclusive policy variables. Such protocols would help avoid ad hoc theorizing. © 2018 Policy Studies Organization","immigration; methodology; minority political power; racial threat","immigration policy; measurement method; methodology; minority group; political power; race; social theory","","","","","Russell Sage Foundation, RSF, (88.15.05)","","Achen C.H., Bartels L.M., Democracy for Realists: Why Elections Do Not Produce Responsive Government, (2016); Alba R., Rumbaut R.G., Marotz K., A Distorted Nation: Perceptions of Racial/Ethnic Group Sizes and Attitudes toward Immigrants and other Minorities, Social Forces, 84, 2, pp. 901-919, (2005); Arnold D.R., The Logic of Congressional Action, (1990); Avery J.M., Fine J.A., Marquez T., Racial Threat and the Influence of Latino Turnout on State Immigration Policy, Social Science Quarterly, 98, 2, pp. 750-765, (2017); Banting K., Kymlicka W., Is there Really a Retreat from Multiculturalism Policies: New Evidence from the Multiculturalism Policy Index, Comparative European Politics, 11, 5, pp. 577-598, (2013); Barreto M., Si Se Puede!

Large-scale population movements between different areas increase the risk of cross-infection and bring great challenges to epidemic prevention and control. As COVID-19 can spread rapidly through human-to-human transmission, understanding its migration patterns is essential to modeling its spreading and evaluating the efficiency of mitigation policies applied to COVID-19. Using nationwide mobile phone data to track population flows throughout China at prefecture-level, we use the temporal network analysis to compare topological metrics of population mobility network during two consecutive months between before and after the outbreak, i.e. January 1st to February 29th. To detect the regions which are closely connected with population movements, we propose a Spatial-Louvain algorithm through adapting a gravity attenuation factor. Moreover, our proposed algorithm achieves an improvement of 14% in modularity compared with the Louvain algorithm. Additionally, we divide the period into four stages, i.e. normal time, Chunyun migration, epidemic interventions, and recovery time, to describe the patterns of mobility network's evolution. Through the above methods, we explore the evolution pattern and spatial mechanism of the population mobility from the perspective of spatiotemporal big data and acquire some meaningful findings. Firstly, we find that after the lockdown of Wuhan and effective epidemic interventions, a substantial reduction in mobility lasted until mid-February. Secondly, based on the economic interaction and geographic location, China has formed an urban agglomeration structure with core cities centering and radiating toward the surroundings. Thirdly, in the extreme cases, the dominant factor of population mobility in remote areas is geographic location rather than economy. Fourthly, the urban agglomeration structure of cities is robust so that when the epidemic weakens or disappears, the city clusters can quickly recover into their original patterns. © 2021 Chinese Physical Society.","COVID-19; Mobile big data; Population flow; Spatio-temporal evolution","Agglomeration; Cellular telephones; Disease control; Population dynamics; Attenuation factors; Economic interactions; Geographic location; Human-to-human transmission; Mitigation policies; Prevention and controls; Substantial reduction; Urban agglomerations; Population statistics","","","","","Key R&D Program of Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Department, China, (2019GK213); Science and Technology New Coronary Pneumonia Emergency Program of Sichuan Province, (2020YFS0007); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71901067, 72001211, 82041020, 91846301); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2020JJ5679); China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists, (72025405)","* Project supported by the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China (Grant No. 72025405), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 82041020, 71901067, 72001211), the Major Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 91846301), the Science and Technology New Coronary Pneumonia Emergency Program of Sichuan Province, China (Grant No. 2020YFS0007), the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China (Grant No. 2020JJ5679), and the Key R&D Program of Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Department, China (Grant No. 2019GK213). † Corresponding author.

Based on Baidu migration big data and COVID-19 cases data released by the national health commission of people's republic of China combined with mathematical statistics analysis and geographic information technology, OLS test and geographically weighted regression were used to analyze the correlation between the spread of COVID-19 and Baidu migration network from January 10 to March 14, 2020.The results showed that the diffusion process of COVID-19 epidemic in China was characterized by stages, including outbreak, potential diffusion, rapid diffusion, diffusion inhibition and diffusion reduction. In the study period, there is a certain spatial correlation between the COVID-19 epidemic data and the difference coefficient of inflow and outflow and the external connection degree of provinces. Through the OLS test of population migration index, it was found that the correlation between the difference coefficient of inflow and outflow and the spread of epidemic was more significant, and there was no collinear effect. The correlation analysis showed that there was a correlation between the epidemic data and the difference coefficient of inflow and outflow in spatial location, and most of them were negative correlation in the early stage, and gradually became positive correlation in the later stage. The negative correlation between Hubei and Hubei was significant, and the positive correlation between Xinjiang, Tibet and Qinghai was significant. It revealed that provinces with large population mobility and high number of confirmed cases were mainly distributed in Hubei Province and the central cities of China's key urban agglomerations, and the epidemic prevention pressure was mainly due to the risk of transmission and diffusion caused by large population mobility and high number of confirmed cases.  © 2021 ACM.","COVID-19; GWR; inflow and outflow difference index; migration big data","Big data; Correlation methods; Diffusion; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Correlation analysis; COVID-19; Difference coefficients; GWR; Inflow and outflow difference index; Large population; Migration big data; Migration networks; Negative correlation; Positive correlations; Epidemiology","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41461038, 41561086, 41661082, 41861048)","This paper received financial support from The National Natural Science Fund under Grant Nos. 41461038, 41561086, 41661082 and 41861048.

These approaches have generated contradictory results. We compare these approaches using observed and simulated data. Methods: We generated 10,000 simulated regions using the correlation structure and distributions from a United Kingdom dataset. We simulated cases using a Poisson distribution with the incidence rate set to the national average assuming the null hypothesis that only population size drives the number of cases. Selection of areas within each simulated region was based on characteristics considered responsible for elevated infection rates (population density and inward migration) and/or elevated leukemia rates. We calculated effect estimates for 10,000 simulations and compared results to corresponding observed data analyses. Results: When the selection of areas for analysis is based on apparent clusters of childhood leukemia, biased assessments occur; the estimated 5-year incidence of childhood leukemia ranged between zero and eight per 10,000 children in contrast to the simulated two cases per 10,000 children, similar to the observed data. Performing analyses on region-wide data avoids these biases. Conclusions: Studies using nonrandom selection to investigate the association between childhood leukemia and population mixing are likely to have generated biased findings. Future studies can avoid such bias using a region-wide analytical strategy. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B431. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, it remains poorly quantified partly because reliable data are often lacking, particularly for low-income countries. The most widely available are migration data from human population censuses, which provide valuable information on relatively long timescale relocations across countries, but do not capture the shorter-scale patterns, trips less than a year, that make up the bulk of human movement. Census-derived migration data may provide valuable proxies for shorter-term movements however, as substantial migration between regions can be indicative of well connected places exhibiting high levels of movement at finer time scales, but this has never been examined in detail. Here, an extensive mobile phone usage data set for Kenya was processed to extract movements between counties in 2009 on weekly, monthly, and annual time scales and compared to data on change in residence from the national census conducted during the same time period. We find that the relative ordering across Kenyan counties for incoming, outgoing and between-county movements shows strong correlations. Moreover, the distributions of trip durations from both sources of data are similar, and a spatial interaction model fit to the data reveals the relationships of different parameters over a range of movement time scales.

From 78 available deployments, 38 were selected for detailed examination based on deployment duration. The points of deployment ranged from southern Newfoundland to the Straits of Florida. The aggregate data comprise the most comprehensive information describing migrations of swordfish in the Atlantic. Challenges in using data from different tag manufacturers are discussed. The relative utility of geolocations obtained with light is compared with results derived from temperature information for this deep-diving species. The results show that fish tagged off North America remain in the western Atlantic throughout their deployments. This is inconsistent with the model of stock structure used in assessments conducted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, which assumes that fish mix freely throughout the North Atlantic.","","Animal Migration; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Fishes; North America; Population Dynamics; Remote Sensing Technology; Seasons; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Scombridae; Xiphias gladius; Article; data collection method; data processing; fish; geographic and geological phenomena; geographic information system; geography; geology; information technology; nonhuman; pop up satellite archival tag; population migration; seasonal variation; species distribution; species diversity; species translocation; swordfish; United States; animal; Atlantic Ocean; North America; population dynamics; remote sensing; season; spatiotemporal analysis","","","","","","","Dewar H., Prince E.D., Musyl M.K., Brill R.W., Sepulveda C., Et al., Movements and behaviours of swordfish in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans examined using pop-up satellite archival tags, Fish.

Based on the big data collected on urban migration during the Spring Festival travel period, this paper constructs geographic, economic and geo-economic matrices, introduces two instrumental variables, and uses a spatial econometric model to investigate the mechanism between population mobility and urban economic resilience. The results show that (1) urban economic resilience exhibits spatial correlation, and the correlation order is geo-economic matrix > economic matrix > geography matrix; (2) the economic resilience of inflow areas is significantly affected by the net inflow of population, and the urban economic resilience index increases by 0.36–0.56% when the population mobility index increases by one unit; (3) in the case of economic and geo-economic matrices, there is a spatial interaction relationship of neighbor-companion in the mechanism of population migration on urban economic resilience; and (4) the mechanism is significantly impacted by innovation input and fixed asset investment, with positive moderating effects. In the geographical and economic matrices, the innovation input effect has a negative externality, while in the economic and geo-economic matrices, the fixed asset investment effect has a positive externality. © 2022 by the authors.","Baidu migration big data; instrumental variable; population mobility; urban economic resilience","Big Data; China; Cities; Economic Development; Population Dynamics; China; data management; econometrics; migration; mobility; urban economy; urban planning; article; big data; China; city; econometric model; geography; instrumental variable analysis; investment; negative externality; population migration; positive externality; spring; travel; China; city; economic development; population dynamics","","","","","China Social Science Foundation, (18VSJ036, 21ZDA115); Henan Institutions of Higher Learning, (2019-YXXZ-20); Philosophy and Social Science Innovation Team Building Program of Henan Universities, (2021-CXTD-12, 2022-CXTD-05); Support Plan for Scientific and Technological Innovation Talents in Henan Institutions of Higher Learning, (2018-cx-012); Henan Office of Philosophy and Social Science, (2021BJJ112); Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2022-YYZD-27)","This work was supported by grants from Support Plan for Scientific and Technological Innovation Talents in Henan Institutions of Higher Learning (humanities and social sciences) (2018-cx-012); Good Scholar in Philosophy and Social Sciences in Henan Institutions of Higher Learning (2019-YXXZ-20); and Philosophy and Social Science Innovation Team Building Program of Henan Universities (2021-CXTD-12, 2022-CXTD-05); Philosophy and Social Science planning project of Henan Province (2021BJJ112); Applied Research project of Philosophy and Social Science of Henan Province (2022-YYZD-27); and Major projects of China Social Science Foundation (18VSJ036, 21ZDA115).","Pendall R., Foster K.A., Cowell M., Resilience and regions: Building understanding of the metaphor, Camb.

Quite a few population estimate approaches have been proposed and multiple gridded population datasets have been produced. However, it is still a challenge to accurately estimate daily and even hourly population dynamics. In this study, we present an ensemble learning approach to tackle the challenge through integrating a digital footprint dataset and multiple geospatial ancillary datasets to estimate population dynamics. More specifically, we used the geographically weighted regression model to integrate two aspatial tree-based learning models and generated preliminary hourly and daily gridded population estimates. We then adjusted the fine-scale population estimates based on the county-level estimates and their nonlinear relationship with the grid-level covariates. After sufficient model training and parameter tuning, we produced a series 0.01-degree gridded population maps (FinePop) of China for 2018, including a nationwide daily-average map and provincial hourly-average maps. The FinePop is more accurate than the WorldPop and LandScan datasets, as suggested by the highest R2 (0.72) obtained from the comparison against township-level population census data. The root mean squared error of the township population density estimates for FinePop, WorldPop, and LandScan are 3162, 3327, and 3423, respectively. The FinePop also shows its advantages in unraveling transportation networks and the diurnal-nocturnal population migration patterns in both small and large cities. © 2022 The Author(s)","Digital footprint; Dynamic population distribution; Ensemble learning; Geospatial big data; Spatial dependence","China; data set; digital mapping; digitization; error analysis; GIS; learning; nonlinearity; population dynamics; population estimation; population migration; spatial analysis; spatial data","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41901395); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program), (2017YFB0503605, 2017YFC1503003)","This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, No.2017YFC1503003, No.2017YFB0503605; National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.41901395.

People search engines, such as WhitePages (), gather personal-level demographic data, including full name, address, age and household members. Requiring only a surname and locational reference (e.g. city or postal code) as the minimum search criteria, such people search engines can be perceived as a gigantic database of demographic records. The objective of this article is to outline the development of a web-based demographic data extraction tool for population monitoring. In this study, a web prototype was developed to extract web demographics of the Vietnamese-American (VA) population in Texas, an ethnic minority with unique migration history, from WhitePages. After post-processing, the personal-level demographic data represent 40.3% of 202,003 VA in Texas reported by the American Community Survey (ACS) 2009. While all enumeration strategies, the web approach included, have their own strengths and weaknesses, this study suggests an alternative approach that is complementary to existing enumeration strategies. More research and development are needed to validate the accuracy of web demographics and further enhance data navigation and extraction rules. The utilization and release of web demographics must be cautious with regards to privacy and integrity of personal identity. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","Texas; United States; Data mining; Extraction; Population statistics; Websites; Data extraction; Demographic data; Household members; People searches; Population monitoring; Postal code; Search criterion; Vietnamese; Wealth of information; Web based; data processing; demographic survey; ethnic minority; GIS; monitoring; population dynamics; World Wide Web; Search engines","","","","","","","Anderson M.J., Fienberg S.E., Who Counts?

Some of the other problems that are faced by the area are disposal of industrial effluent posing threat to its sustainability of water resource. Textiles, dyeing and printing industries, various mechanical process and chemical/synthetic dyes are used and considerable wastewater discharged from these textile units contains about high amount of the dyes into the adjoining drainages. This has caused degradation of water quality in this water scarce semi-arid region of the country. Pali city is located South-West, 70 Kms from Jodhpur in western Rajasthan (India). There are four Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) treating wastewater to meet the pollutant level permissible to river discharge, a huge amount of effluent water of these factories directly meets the into the river Bandi - a tributary of river Luni. In order to monitor the impact of industrial effluents on the environment, identifying the extent of the degradation and evolving possible means of minimizing the impacts studies on quality of effluents, polluted river water and water of adjoining wells, the contamination migration of the pollutants from the river to ground water were studied. Remote sensing analysis has been carried out using Resourcesat -1 multispectral satellite data along with DEM derived from IRS P5 stereo pair. GIS database generated of various thematic layers viz. base layer - inventorying all waterbodies in the vicinity, transport network and village layer, drainage, geomorphology, structure, land use. Analysis of spatial distribution of the features and change detection in land use/cover carried out. GIS maps have been used to help factor in spatial location of source and hydro-geomorphological settings. DEM & elevation contour helped in delineation of watershed and identifying flow modelling boundaries. Litholog data analysis carried out for aquifer boundaries using specialized software. Establishment of other boundary conditions was based on well data. Calibration and validation of was done using ground water modelling software. Change detection analysis indicated areas of impact on land use/cover particularly, agriculture activity. Normalised difference vegetation index found to have negative correlation with pollution level. Population dynamics have been studied and it is found to be poorly correlated with land degradation. Water levels do not show significant variations in past twenty years baring normal seasonal fluctuation. Chemical analysis of ground water samples studies in time series. The water quality studied through various parameters shows concentration in mid-reach of the Bandi river. Analysis of litholog data shows three unconfined aquifers. Pump test and resistivity survey was carried out for initial aquifer properties in local water levels. Modelling contaminant migration helped in prediction of the extent of the adversity. Surface flow is checked allowing more water but it is proving to be accumulation point in absence of good rainfall & flow in the river. Hotspots of dumping/active contamination were identified with certain remediation efforts and supply of solid waste to cement industry in addition to bio-filter for heavy metals. © 2012 ISPRS.","Change detection; GIS; Land use; Modelling; Pollution; Remote sensing","Aquifers; Arid regions; Cement industry; Chemical analysis; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Geographic information systems; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Heavy metals; Hydrogeology; Land use; Models; Network layers; Photogrammetry; Pollution; Pollution detection; Rain; Remote sensing; Rivers; Sewage; Signal detection; Sustainable development; Textile industry; Textiles; Time series analysis; Vegetation; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Water levels; Water pollution; Water quality; Water resources; Water treatment; Calibration and validations; Change detection; Change detection analysis; Effluent treatment plants; Modelling contaminants; Multispectral satellite data; Normalised difference vegetation index; Remote sensing analysis; River pollution","","","","","","","","","Shortis M.; Madden M.","International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","ESRI; Hexagon; RMIT University, School of Mathematical and Geospatial Sciences","22nd Congress of the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, ISPRS 2012","25 August 2012 through 1 September 2012","Melbourne","111123","16821750","","","","English","Int.

This task has been based on the application of Monte Carlo simulation for the projection of the new population from the original one using birth, mortality, immigration and emigration data to model it. It has been applied both with current trends and with modified ones according to the user selections in order to obtain and analyse possible alternative scenarios. An inverse process is also presented, where a desired population pyramid is provided, and the system, based on genetic algorithms, determines the modifications of the previously stated rates to get the most similar output. Both tools are applied to a particular situation, the municipalities of a province in the north of Spain, so the functionality of the whole methodology is shown in an empiric way. These results show that projections are accurate with respect to the real data available to contrast, as well as that the inverse system generates close pyramids to the desired ones under reasonable circumstances. Additionally, these approaches have novel functionalities and make use of techniques not widely applied in the field, thus making them innovative with respect to other noteworthy examples in the field. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Data analysis; Demography; Genetic algorithms; Monte Carlo simulation","Demography; Intelligent systems; Inverse problems; Monte Carlo methods; Population dynamics; Population statistics; 'current; Inverse process; Inverse system; Monte Carlo's simulation; User selection; Genetic algorithms","","","","","","","European Statistical Office (Eurostat, (2019); Report on the impact of demographic change, (2020); Reynaud C., Miccoli S., Depopulation and the aging population: the relationship in italian municipalities, Sustainability, 10, 4, (2018); Almeida M.A.P.D., Fighting depopulation in portugal: local and central government policies in times of crisis, Port J Soc Sci, 17, 3, pp. 289-309, (2018); Collantes F., Pinilla V., Saez L.A., Silvestre J., Reducing depopulation in rural spain: the impact of immigration: the impact of immigration, Popul Space Place, 20, 7, pp. 606-621, (2014); Wang C.-Y., Lee S.-J., Regional population forecast and analysis based on machine learning strategy, Entropy (Basel), 23, 6, (2021); Raftery A.E., Sevcikova H., Probabilistic population forecasting: Short to very long-term, Int J Forecast, (2021); Morgenstern J.D., Buajitti E., O'Neill M., Piggott T., Goel V., Fridman D., Kornas K., Rosella L.C., Predicting population health with machine learning: a scoping review, BMJ Open, 10, 10, (2020); Bivand R.S., Wilk J., Kossowski T., Spatial association of population pyramids across europe: the application of symbolic data, cluster analysis and join-count tests, Spat Stat, 21, pp. 339-361, (2017); Przewozniczek M.W., Dziurzanski P., Zhao S., Indrusiak L.S., Multi-objective parameter-less population pyramid for solving industrial process planning problems, Swarm Evol Comput, 60, (2021); Gandomi A.H., Goldman B.W., Parameter-less population pyramid for large-scale tower optimization, Expert Syst Appl, 96, pp. 175-184, (2018); Sin G., Espuna A., Editorial: applications of monte carlo method in chemical, biochemical and environmental engineering, Front Energy Res, 8, (2020); Zivkovic M., Zlatanovic M., Zlatanovic N., Golubovic M., Veselinovic A.M., The application of the combination of monte carlo optimization method based QSAR modeling and molecular docking in drug design and development.

In this study, we analyze the extent that schools and classrooms provide refugee students with equitable educational opportunities compared to students who are not refugees, and whether their teachers feel prepared for and engaged in culturally responsive instructional practices. Using survey data on 130,803 teachers and 8,054 schools sampled from 41 predominantly distant resettlement host countries in the 2018 Teaching and Learning International Survey, we find lower levels of resources, safety, and social inclusion for refugee students but higher levels of preparation and instructional practices in multicultural education among their teachers. The results have policy implications for supporting students with refugee backgrounds in different school contexts. © 2023 AERA.","comparative education; correlational analysis; descriptive analysis; equity; immigration/immigrants; inclusion; international education; migration; multicultural education; refugee students; regression analyses; secondary data analysis; teacher education/development","","","","","","","","Bajaj M., Argenal A., Canlas M., Socio-politically relevant pedagogy for immigrant and refugee youth, Equity and Excellence in Education, 50, 3, pp. 258-274, (2017); Bajaj M., Bartlett L., Critical transnational curriculum for immigrant and refugee students, Curriculum Inquiry, 47, 1, pp. 25-35, (2017); Banks C., Banks J., Reforming schools in a democratic pluralistic society, Educational Policy, 2, 11, pp. 183-193, (1997); Banks J., Citizenship education and diversity: Implications for teacher education, Journal of Teacher Education, 52, 1, pp. 5-16, (2001); Block K., Cross S., Riggs E., Gibbs L., Supporting schools to create an inclusive environment for refugee students, International Journal of Inclusive Education, 18, 12, pp. 1337-1355, (2014); Cazzetta H.M., Colombian institutional responses to the Venezuelan refugee crisis, Refugees and Higher Education, pp. 49-65, (2020); Chopra V., Dryden-Peterson S., Borders and belonging: Displaced Syrian youth navigating symbolic boundaries in Lebanon, Globalisation, Societies and Education, 18, 4, pp. 449-463, (2020); Cooc N., Kim G.M., Critical teaching in diverse classroom, Teaching as a knowledge profession: Studying pedagogical knowledge across education systems, pp. 65-86, (2021); Cun A., Concerns and expectations: Burmese refugee parents’ perspectives on their children’s learning in American schools, Early Childhood Education Journal, 48, 3, pp. 263-272, (2020); Czaika M., Kraler A., Refugees, Wiley Blackwell Companion to Race, Ethnicity, and Nationalism, pp. 321-348, (2020); Devictor X., Do Q.T., How many years have refugees been in exile?, (2016); Dryden-Peterson S., Refugee education: The crossroads of globalization, Educational Researcher, 45, 9, pp. 473-482, (2016); Dryden-Peterson S., Civic education and the education of refugees, Intercultural Education, 31, 5, pp. 592-606, (2020); Dryden-Peterson S., Dahya N., Adelman E., Pathways to educational success among refugees: Connecting locally and globally situated resources, American Educational Research Journal, 54, 6, pp. 1011-1047, (2017); Fylkesnes S., Whiteness in teacher education research discourses: A review of the use and meaning making of the term cultural diversity, Teaching and Teacher Education, 71, pp. 24-33, (2018); Garcia O., Sylvan C.E., Pedagogies and practices in multilingual classrooms: Singularities in pluralities, Modern Language Journal, 95, 3, pp. 385-400, (2011); Gorski P.C., What we’re teaching teachers: An analysis of multicultural teacher education coursework syllabi, Teaching and Teacher Education, 25, 2, pp. 309-318, (2009); Hernandez Sheets R., Competency vs. good intentions: Diversity ideologies and teacher potential, International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education, 16, 1, pp. 111-120, (2003); Hoon M.D., Vink M., Schmeets H., A ticket to mobility?

Outcome variables were women's BMI and nutrition transition. Nutrition transition was based on fifteen different household food groups and was adjusted for socio-economic and demographic characteristics. Stepwise backward multiple ordinal regression analysis was applied.Setting: Kenya Demographic and Health Survey 2014.Participants: Rural non-migrant, rural-to-urban migrant and urban non-migrant women aged 15-49 years (n 6171).Results: Crude data analysis showed rural-to-urban migration to be associated with overweight/obesity risk and nutrition transition. After adjustment for household wealth, no significant differences between rural non-migrants and rural-to-urban migrants for overweight/obesity risk and household consumption of several food groups characteristic of nutrition transition (animal-source, fats and sweets) were observed. Regardless of wealth, migrants were less likely to consume main staples and legumes, and more likely to consume fruits and vegetables. Identified predictive factors of overweight/obesity among migrant women were age, duration of residence in urban area, marital status and household wealth.Conclusions: Our analysis showed that nutrition transition and overweight/obesity risk among rural-to-urban migrants is apparent with increasing wealth in urban areas. Several predictive factors were identified characterising migrant women being at risk for overweight/obesity. Future research is needed which investigates in depth the association between rural-to-urban migration and wealth to address inequalities in diet and overweight/obesity in Kenya. © The Authors 2019.","Kenya;

Moreover, there are limited longitudinal data about consumption patterns in this population. As such, this study aimed to compare the smoking and heavy drinking prevalence among rural, urban, and rural-to-urban migrants in Peru, as well as the smoking and heavy drinking incidence in a 5-year follow-up. Methods: We analyzed the PERU MIGRANT Study data from rural, urban, and rural-to-urban migrant populations in Peru. The baseline study was carried out in 2006-2007 and follow-up was performed five years later. For the baseline data analysis, the prevalence of lifetime smoking, current smokers, and heavy drinking was compared by population group using prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For the longitudinal analysis, the incidence of smoking and heavy drinking was compared by population group with risk ratios (RR) and 95% CI. Poisson regression with robust variance was used to calculate both PRs and RRs. Results: We analyzed data from 988 participants: 200 rural dwellers, 589 migrants, and 199 urban dwellers. Compared with migrants, lifetime smoking prevalence was higher in the urban group (PR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.64-3.20), but lower in the rural group (PR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.31-0.99). Compared with migrants, the urban group had a higher current smoking prevalence (PR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.26-4.16), and a higher smoking incidence (RR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.03-7.34). Current smoking prevalence and smoking incidence showed no significant difference between rural and migrant groups. The prevalence and incidence of heavy drinking was similar across the three population groups. Conclusions: Our results show a trend in lifetime smoking prevalence (urban > migrant > rural), while smoking incidence was similar between migrant and rural groups, but higher in the urban group. In addition, our results suggest that different definitions of smoking status could lead to different smoking rates and potentially different measures of association. The prevalence and incidence of heavy drinking were similar between the three population groups. © 2017 The Author(s).","Alcohol Consumption; Cigarette Consumption; Heavy Drinking; Migration","Alcohol Drinking; Female; Humans; Incidence; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Peru; Poisson Distribution; Population Dynamics; Prevalence; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Smoking; Transients and Migrants; Urban Population; alcohol abuse; alcohol consumption; confidence interval; controlled study; data analysis; drinking behavior; follow up; human; major clinical study; migrant; Peru; prevalence; smoking; comparative study; drinking behavior; epidemiology; female; incidence; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; migration; odds ratio; Peru; Poisson distribution; population dynamics; regression analysis; risk factor; rural population; smoking; statistics and numerical data; urban population","","","","","Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, (103994/Z/14/Z, 20205071009); Wellcome Trust, WT, (074833/Z/04/A); Medical Research Council, MRC, (MR/K006584/1, MR/K007467/1)","The PERU MIGRANT Study baseline assessment work was funded through by a Wellcome Trust Master Research Training Fellowship and a Wellcome Trust PhD Studentship to JJM (Grant number 074833/Z/04/A), and its follow up by Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (Fondo Concursable No. 20205071009).

The imbalance in population flow network during the Spring Festival travel rush is significant, with unbalanced coefficients and relevant frequencies of the population flow network in the Eastern and Western Regions being significantly higher than in other regions. The unbalanced coefficients in the Central Region are lower, followed by corresponding frequencies, while the unbalanced coefficients in the Northeast Region are evenly distributed with the lowest frequencies. The population flow toward the West and Northwest are relatively concentrated, while the population flow toward the South and Southwest are relatively scattered. (2). The regional imbalance during the Spring Festival travel rush has characteristics of spatial agglomeration, where a strongly-connected Southeast Subsystem and a weakly-connected Western Subsystem are formed; there is a significant leverage effect in Guangdong Province, which greatly affects the regional imbalance. Three characteristics emerge in the distribution of regional population flow—the outflow, inflow, and outflow along the Eastern, Central and Western strips/lines, respectively. The paper emphasizes the importance of researching imbalance issues, clarifies the difference between the imbalance of the population flow network and the imbalance involved in previous population research fields, and discusses the Spring Festival Effect in terms of population flow and deficiencies in research. © 2021 Gao et al.","","China; Holidays; Humans; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Time Factors; Travel; big data; China; population research; review; spring; travel; China; human; leisure; population density; population dynamics; season; time factor; travel","","","","","","","Chen MX, Huang XR, Huang GZ, Yang YS., New urbanization and informal employment: Scale, pattern, and social integration, Progress in Geography, 40, 1, pp. 50-60, (2021); Chen MX, Ye C, Lu DD, Sui YW, Guo SS., Cognition and construction of the theoretical connotations of new urbanization with Chinese characteristics [J], Journal of Geographical Sciences, 29, 10, pp. 1681-1698, (2019); Hunt GL., Equilibrium and disequilibrium in migration modelling, Reg Stud, 27, 4, pp. 341-349, (1993); Harrigan FJ, Mcgregor PG., Equilibrium and disequilibrium perspectives on regional labor migration, J Reg Sci, 33, 1, pp. 49-67, (1993); Schachter J, Althaus PG., An equilibrium model of gross migration, J Reg Sci, 29, 2, pp. 143-159, (1989); Lessmann C., Spatial inequality and development-Is there an inverted-U relationship?, Journal of Development Economics, 106, c, pp. 35-51, (2014); Salvati L., Towards (spatially) unbalanced development?

This implies that organisms perceive – with sufficient accuracy – information about population density. However, research on the fitness value of such information, the adequate use of imprecise information, and how information use affects overall dispersal has only just started. A critical issue in such research necessarily concerns the adequate rule linking an individual's population density estimate to its readiness to emigrate; a spectrum of such rules has been proposed in the past. We use three prevalent rules and one rule specifically derived for situations of incomplete information to demonstrate that the adequacy of each rule strongly depends on the accuracy of information about population density: Simple bang–bang (threshold) behavior performs best if information is highly inaccurate, whereas a saturating response function (dispersal propensity gradually increasing with population density) out-competes all other strategies when individuals can estimate density accurately. The decision rule as well as the precision of information significantly influence average emigration probabilities establishing in metapopulations. Our results show that use of inadequate rules in models of dispersal evolution may lead to false dispersal decisions. Based on this analysis we present a rule that allows approximating an adequate dispersal response at the population level even when individuals possess incomplete information about local density. We conclude that individuals should generally invest little into the acquisition of (accurate) information even if such acquisition is associated with only small costs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Decision rule; Density-dependent dispersal; Evolutionary tournament; Information processing","Biology; Data processing; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Accuracy of information; Decision rules; Density dependent; Evolutionary tournament; Imprecise information; Incomplete information; Limited information; Population densities; accuracy assessment; cost analysis; decision making; density dependence; dispersal; evolutionary biology; fitness; information processing; metapopulation; population density; probability; research work; spectrum; Information use","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (DFG HO2051/3-1, SFB 1047)","This research was supported by funds from the German Research Foundation: HJP , AK and TH by grant DFG HO2051/3-1 , OM by the Collaborative Research Center SFB 1047 “Insect timing”, Project C6.

On the other hand, supply of spectrum, an essential resource for mobile services, is restricted due to competing nature of uses and vested interests of incumbent holders. This book begins by presenting the theoretical framework governing the technology, and economics of spectrum. Examples derived from practices around the world are given to illustrate the underlying principles. Future technologies that enable effective use of spectrum are documented along with the accompanying economic rationale and policy prescriptions. The significant addition in this book is the illustration of the migration from the command and control regime of spectrum allocation to flexible methods and further towards the spectrum of the commons. The regulatory and policy implications are discussed drawing parallels to practices around the world. The theoretical framework forms the basis of two extensive chapters devoted to the Indian case: the first chapter addresses spectrum management in India, starting from the initial allocation in 1995 to the substantial controversies surrounding the First Come First Serve principle practiced during the 2000s to the liberalization and auction of spectrum in 2012-13; the second on broadcast spectrum discusses the developments relating to digitization of terrestrial and satellite broadcasting and its implications for mobile services including release of digital dividend spectrum. © Oxford University Press 2014.

Objective: To investigate the risks of kidney failure and death in adults with incident stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD). Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study obtained data recorded between July 30, 2002, and March 31, 2014, from the linked laboratory and administrative data set of Alberta Health in Alberta, Canada. All adults of the province of Alberta with stage IV CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 15-30 mL/min/1.73 m2) were eligible for inclusion. Included individuals were followed up from study entry until the date of kidney failure, death, or censoring, whichever occurred first. Observations were censored at the date of emigration from the province, the study end date (March 31, 2017), or at 10 years after study entry. Data analyses were performed from January 2020 to June 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was kidney failure, defined as the earlier of either renal replacement (dialysis or kidney transplant) initiation or severe kidney impairment (eGFR <10 mL/min/1.73 m2). Incidence of stage IV CKD in Alberta was examined over time, along with the association between age at study entry and the competing risks of kidney failure and death. Cumulative incidence functions (95% CIs) were estimated to summarize absolute risks over time across categories of age, accounting for sex, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, eGFR, and albuminuria. Results: The study included 30801 adults (mean [SD] age, 76.8 [13.3] years; 17294 women [56.1%]) with stage IV CKD. Of these, 5511 developed kidney failure (17.9%) and 16285 died (52.9%). The incidence rate of stage IV CKD increased sharply with advancing age; the absolute risk of kidney failure decreased with advancing age, and the risk of death increased, especially in those aged 85 years or older. Compared with the 5-year risk of death, the 5-year risk of kidney failure was higher in people younger than 65 years, similar in people aged 65 to 74 years, and lower for older age groups. For those aged 75 years or older, the risk of death was much higher than the risk of kidney failure: 6-fold higher among those aged 75 to 84 years (0.51 [95% CI, 0.5-0.52] vs 0.09 [95% CI, 0.08-0.09]) and 25-fold higher among those aged 85 years or older (0.75 [95% CI, 0.74-0.76] vs 0.03 [95% CI, 0.02-0.03]). The risk of death was higher than the risk of kidney failure by 24-fold among those aged 85 to 94 years (0.73 [95% CI, 0.72-0.74] vs 0.03 [95% CI, 0.02-0.03]) and by 149-fold among those aged 95 years or older (0.89 [95% CI, 0.87-0.92] vs <0.01 [95% CI, <0.01 to 0.01]). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that, although the incidence rate of stage IV CKD increased with advancing age, the absolute risk of kidney failure decreased. Unlike other age-related conditions, the expected increase in the burden of kidney failure in the older adults may be less dramatic than expected.  © 2020 Ravani P et al.","","Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over;

In the context of the coordinated development of the urban agglomeration of the Yellow River Ji-shaped bend (UAYB), this study identifies the hierarchical spatial structure of the UAYB through a combination of Baidu migration big data and traditional data. The following conclusions can be drawn. (1) The cities with the strongest regional comprehensive power are Ordos, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Yinchuan, and Yulin, which cause the UAYB to present a significant ""center-periphery""spatial pattern. (2) The biggest population flows mostly occur between cities in the same province, while interprovincial population flows mainly exist between cities with the strongest comprehensive power. (3) The hierarchical spatial structure of the UAYB forms a multitree structure, with Ordos as the core. (4) The attractiveness of the UAYB is very weak, being only slightly attractive to individual surrounding provinces, while the population outflow index to economically developed areas is high. Several policy implications are proposed, which can provide important insights for planning intercity connections among the UAYB, in order to achieve more coordinated regional development.  © 2021 Fang Wang et al.","","Public policy; Regional planning; Urban growth; Policy implications; Population flow; Regional development; Space of flows; Spatial patterns; Spatial structure; Urban agglomerations; Urban development levels; Agglomeration","","","","","","","Fang C., Progress and the future direction of research into urban agglomeration in China, Acta Geographica Sinica, 69, 8, pp. 1130-1144, (2014); Gu C., A prelimanary study on the division of urban ecomonic regions in China, Acta Geographica Sinica, 46, 2, pp. 129-141, (1991); Wang S., Lian C., Zhao Z., From central place to city network: A theoretical change in China's urban system study, Geographical Research, 38, 1, pp. 64-74, (2019); Taylor P.J., Derudder B., World-City Network: A Global Urban Analysis, (2016); Wang Y., Niu X., Song X., Research progress of regional spatial structure under the perspective of space of flow, Urban Planning International, 32, 6, pp. 27-33, (2017); Castells M., The Rise of the Network Society, (1996); River Conservancy Commission Y., Review of Yellow River Basin, (1998); The Government Work Report, (2020); Friedmann J., The world city hypothesis, Development and Change, 17, 1, pp. 69-83, (1986); Marshall J.U., The Structure of Urban Systems, (1989); Gaitani N., Santamouris M., Cartalis C., Microclimatic analysis as a prerequisite for sustainable urbanisation: Application for an urban regeneration project for a medium size city in the greater urban agglomeration of Athens, Greece, Sustainable Cities and Society, 13, pp. 230-236, (2014); Lee S.Y., Dunn R.J.K., Young R.A., Impact of urbanization on coastal wetland structure and function, Austral Ecology, 31, 2, pp. 149-163, (2006); Hall P., Pain K., Luo Z., The polycentric metropolis, learning from megacity regions in Europe, Shang-hai Urban Planning Review, 1, (2011); Mitchelson R.L., Wheeler J.O., The flow of information in a global economy: The role of the American urban system in 1990, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 84, 1, pp. 87-107, (1994); Matsumoto H., International urban systems and air passenger and cargo flows: Some calculations, Journal of Air Transport Management, 10, 4, pp. 239-247, (2004); Dai L., Derudder B., Liu X., Transport network backbone extraction: A comparison of techniques, Journal of Transport Geography, 69, pp. 271-281, (2018); Long Y., Thill J.-C., Combining smart card data and household travel survey to analyze jobs-housing relationships in Beijing, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 53, pp. 19-35, (2015); Cesar D., Beauguitte L., Spatial science and network science: Review and outcomes of a complex relationship, Networks and Spatial Economics, 14, 3-4, pp. 297-316, (2014); Derudder B., Witlox F., Faulconbridge J., Beaverstock J., Airline data for global city network research: Reviewing and refining existing approaches, GeoJournal, 71, 1, pp. 5-18, (2008); Ma X., Dou P., Characteristics of polycentricity spatial structure of shangdong coastal city-region based on passenger traffic flow, Modern Urban Research, 10, pp. 101-109, (2017); Cai L., Ma X., Chen W., Characteristics of functional polycentricity of PRD urban region based on passenger traffic flow, Economic Geography, 33, 11, pp. 52-57, (2013); Qiu J., Liu Y., Chen H., Urban network structure of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao greater bay area with the view of space of flows: A comparison between information flow and transportation flow, Economic Geography, 39, 6, pp. 7-15, (2019); Zhou H., Wang F., Research on structure characteristics of the inter-provincial tourist flow spatial network in China based on the modified gravity model, Geographical Research, 39, 3, pp. 669-681, (2020); Wang Z., Yang S., Gong F., Identification of urban agglomerations deformation structure based on urban-flow space: A case study of the Yangtze river delta urban agglomeration, Scientia Geographica Sinica, 37, 9, pp. 1337-1344, (2017); Niu F., Yang X., Wang F., Urban agglomeration formation and its spatiotemporal expansion process in China: From the perspective of industrial evolution, Chinese Geographical Science, 30, 3, pp. 532-543, (2020); Wang S., Gao S., Wang Y., Spatial structure of the urban agglomeration based on space of flows: The study of the Pearl river delta, Geographical Research, 38, 8, pp. 1849-1861, (2019); Niu F., Liu W., Identifying the hierarchical regional spatial structure using internet big data, Journal of Geo-Information Science, 18, 6, pp. 719-726, (2016); Zhang W., Derudder B., How sensitive are measures of polycentricity to the choice of ""centres""?

Viewing Chinese students as an important part of diasporic Chinese community, this paper sheds new light on Chinese students' social networking with different groups internally and externally, both Chinese and non-Chinese, on campus or in the wider community. Many questions arise: What is the contribution of Chinese students to the growth and transformation of diasporic Chinese communities in major destinations? What is the scope of their social networking and what are their functions in regard to Chinese community cohesion and integration? What are the differences between Chinese students and local residents and between Chinese students from mainland China and those from Hong Kong and Singapore in terms of network building and local engagement? The above questions are addressed by a combination of official data analysis and a questionnaire survey conducted in Nottingham. The evidence suggests a correlation between the local engagement of Chinese students in the wider community and their social networking, which offers a key to understand the new momentum for the transformation of diasporic Chinese community in major he destinations.

Quantitative models mathematically reflect scientific hypotheses about how a system functions. In Delaware Bay, mid-Atlantic Coast, USA, to more effectively manage horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) harvests and protect Red Knot (Calidris canutus rufa) populations, models are used to compare harvest actions and predict the impacts on crab and knot populations. Management has been chiefly driven by the core hypothesis that horseshoe crab egg abundance governs the survival and reproduction of migrating Red Knots that stopover in the Bay during spring migration. However, recently, hypotheses proposing that knot dynamics are governed by cyclical lemming dynamics garnered some support in data analyses. In this paper, I present alternative models of Red Knot population dynamics to reflect alternative hypotheses. Using 2 models with different lemming population cycle lengths and 2 models with different horseshoe crab effects, I project the knot population into the future under environmental stochasticity and parametric uncertainty with each model. I then compare each model's predictions to 10 yr of population monitoring from Delaware Bay. Using Bayes' theorem and model weight updating, models can accrue weight or support for one or another hypothesis of population dynamics. With 4 models of Red Knot population dynamics and only 10 yr of data, no hypothesis clearly predicted population count data better than another. The collapsed lemming cycle model performed best, accruing ∼35% of the model weight, followed closely by the horseshoe crab egg abundance model, which accrued ∼30% of the weight. The models that predicted no decline or stable populations (i.e. the 4-yr lemming cycle model and the weak horseshoe crab effect model) were the most weakly supported. © 2015 Cooper Ornithological Society.","Bayesian model weight updating;

This study, based on Tencent's daily migration data (2015-2018), analyzed and explored the patterns of population inflows and outflows in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau by means of methods like time series analysis, social networks analysis and space-time statistical analysis, and discussed the seasonal law of the fluid population between the study area and other cities in China and the network features of population interaction. The results indicated that: (1) The population flow in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was featured by seasonal variability, which could be represented as four seasons ""Low, Medium, Mid-High, High"" during the year. From 2015 to 2018, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the interaction network of national urban floating population witnessed an increasing status. The population flow rate improved by 8.2%, and the ranking on the population mobility network increased by 24.5%. Relative to the Low season, the average daily population movements in the Medium season, Mid-High season and High season increased by 14.2%, 26.7% and 57.8%, respectively. (2) The population flow direction lied in the 45° fan-shaped range from NEE-67.5° to SEE-112.5°, and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau had strong and frequent interactions with the capitals of the surrounding provinces. (3) Most cities across the country attached importance to a continual increase of the intensity of population interaction with the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and tourism had played a dominant role in promoting the changing and development. The Hotan and Bayin prefectures in Xinjiang, Chongqing, Guang'an and Meishan in Sichuan, and Sanmenxia in Henan presented a pattern of seasonal rise in the Medium and Mid-High seasons and a pattern of seasonal fall in the High season, reflecting the seasonality of labor export to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In addition, population flow in cities like Turpan, Dongguan and Yuncheng showed a declining trend in the stage of High season as a result of the goods and materials supply relations. © 2020, Science Press.

Taking Guangdong Province as an example, this paper utilizes big data on population migration and the geospatial analysis technique to develop a model to conduct spatiotemporal analysis of COVID-19 risk. The model considers the risk differences among the source cities of population migration as well as the heterogeneity in the socioeconomic characteristics of the destination cities. It further incorporates a time- lag process based on the time distribution of the onset of the imported cases. The model can predict the evolutional trend and spatial distribution of the COVID-19 risk for a certain time period in the future and support the future planning and targeted prevention measures. The research findings indicate that: (1) The COVID- 19 epidemic in Guangdong reached a inflection point on January 29, 2020, and then it showed a gradual decline. (2) Based on the time-lag analysis of the onset of the imported cases, there is a time interval between the case importation and the illness onset, and the cases with an interval of 1- 14 days account for a high proportion. (3) There are obvious spatial differences in the risk of epidemics, based on their imported risk, susceptibility risk, and risk resisting ability. (4) The connection and the scale of population migration as well as the transportation and location factors of the cities in Guangdong's prefecture- level cities and the source regions of the epidemic, all have significant impacts on the risk classification of the cities in the province. The first-tier cities such as Shenzhen and Guangzhou are the high-risk areas. The cities in the Pearl River Delta that are adjacent to Shenzhen and Guangzhou, including Dongguan, Foshan, Huizhou, Zhuhai and Zhongshan, are the medium- risk cities. The eastern, northern, and western parts of Guangdong, which are outside the metropolitan areas of the Pearl River Delta, are classed into low-risk areas. Therefore, the government should take targeted prevention and control measures in different regions based on local conditions and risk classification so as to ensure people's daily life and wellbeing to the greatest possible extent. © 2020, Science Press.

Crowd-sourced family tree data are an untapped source of volunteered geographic information generated by millions of users. These trees contain information on individuals such as birth and death places and years, and kinship ties, and have the potential to support analysis of population dynamics and migration over many generations and far into the past. In this article, we introduce a methodology to measure and map long-term changes in migration flows using a population-scale family-tree data set. Our methodology includes many steps such as extracting migration events, temporal periodization, gravity normalization, and producing time-series flow maps. We study internal migration in the continental United States between 1789 and 1924 using birthplaces and birthyears of children from a cleaned, geocoded, and connected set of family trees from Rootsweb.com.

Much has been developed on its potential to include groups marginalized by capitalism in new development schemes, but to date there has been no work regarding immigrants’ participation specifically. This research aims to fill this gap. Purpose: The article investigates the importance of the partnership between institutions in the host country and immigrants to their insertion in the Solidarity Economy Fairs in Florianópolis. It questions to what extent it has furthered income generation, the formation of social identity, and the construction of community ties. Methods and approach: The approach is anchored in intervention–research, proposing a socio-analytical intervention (Aguiar & Rocha, 2007). To pursue qualitative research, an online form was distributed to participants at the Immigrant Fair. The form comprised semi-structured interviews, with the possibility of giving free answers. Findings: The data analysis reveals the nuances of the life trajectory of recent immigrants in Brazil: people, mostly of Latin American origin, over 30 years of age, seeking economic insertion in another country. For them, the Solidarity Economy has offered a possibility for social and economic insertion in Brazil. The opportunity for marginalized populations to engage with the Solidarity Economy offers an effective tool against systemic competition. The Fair operates as an alternative to the insertion into the capitalist market for outsider groups, enabling new ways to conduct economic life within the capitalist economy. Policy implications: Our findings suggest that the Fair has provided immigrants both the means to obtain a weekly (although unstable) financial income and their social integration—it requires interaction with other immigrants, state agents, tourists, and the local community. The social isolation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has jeopardized both outcomes. In order to consolidate solidarity ventures and immigrants’ enterprises, there is an urgent need to implement a public policy regarding immigrants’ social and economic rights in Santa Catarina State. © The Authors 2021.

Until global eradication is achieved, countries that successfully eliminate the disease will contend with parasite reintroduction through international movement of infected people. Human-mediated parasite mobility is also important within countries near elimination, as it drives parasite flows that affect disease transmission on a subnational scale. Methods: Movement patterns exhibited in census-based migration data are compared with patterns exhibited in a mobile phone data set from Haiti to quantify how well migration data predict short-term movement patterns. Because short-term movement data were unavailable for Mesoamerica, a logistic regression model fit to migration data from three countries in Mesoamerica is used to predict flows of infected people between subnational administrative units throughout the region. Results: Population flows predicted using census-based migration data correlated strongly with mobile phone-derived movements when used as a measure of relative connectivity. Relative population flows are therefore predicted using census data across Mesoamerica, informing the areas that are likely exporters and importers of infected people. Relative population flows are used to identify community structure, useful for coordinating interventions and elimination efforts to minimize importation risk. Finally, the ability of census microdata inform future intervention planning is discussed in a country-specific setting using Costa Rica as an example. Conclusions: These results show long-term migration data can effectively predict the relative flows of infected people to direct malaria elimination policy, a particularly relevant result because migration data are generally easier to obtain than short-term movement data such as mobile phone records. Further, predicted relative flows highlight policy-relevant population dynamics, such as major exporters across the region, and Nicaragua and Costa Rica's strong connection by movement of infected people, suggesting close coordination of their elimination efforts. Country-specific applications are discussed as well, such as predicting areas at relatively high risk of importation, which could inform surveillance and treatment strategies. © 2016 Ruktanonchai et al.","Census data;

Chronic disease education is a key to the prevention and control of chronic diseases for such population. The national population-based Migrants Population Dynamic Monitoring Survey (MPSMA) was used to examine the current status and delivery methods of chronic disease education among internal migrants, from both provincial level and individual’s level. The study population included 402 587 internal migrants. Multilevel logistic regression was used to investigate factors that were related to chronic diseases education. In total, only 33.9% of the participants received chronic disease education. In the final model, parameter estimates on key variables from both individual and provincial level were significant (P <.001). Participants from provinces with higher level of health care resources and lower density of internal migrants were more likely to receive chronic disease education. The percentage and methods of receiving education varied across different age groups. This study suggests that future chronic disease education in China need to be more focused on areas with high density of internal migrants and younger internal migrants with low level of education and income. Attention should be paid to use tailored education methods to different populations. © The Author(s) 2019.","chronic disease; health education; health services accessibility; internal migrants; secondary data analysis","Adult;

The population considers the presence of susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic and symptomatic infected, quarantined, recovered and vaccinated individuals. In turn, the mathematical model considers various mechanisms of interaction between the sub-populations in addition to population migration. Methods: The steady-state solutions for the disease-free and endemic scenarios are calculated, and the local stability of the equilibium solutions is determined using linear analysis, Descartes’ rule of signs and the Routh–Hurwitz criterion. We demonstrate rigorously the existence and uniqueness of non-negative solutions for the mathematical model, and we prove that the system has no periodic solutions using Dulac's criterion. To solve this system, a nonstandard finite-difference method is proposed. Results: As the main results, we show that the computer method presented in this work is uniquely solvable, and that it preserves the non-negativity of initial approximations. Moreover, the steady-state solutions of the continuous model are also constant solutions of the numerical scheme, and the stability properties of those solutions are likewise preserved in the discrete scenario. Furthermore, we establish the consistency of the scheme and, using a discrete form of Gronwall's inequality, we prove theoretically the stability and the convergence properties of the scheme. For convenience, a Matlab program of our method is provided in the appendix. Conclusions: The computer method presented in this work is a nonstandard scheme with multiple dynamical and numerical properties. Most of those properties are thoroughly confirmed using computer simulations. Its easy implementation make this numerical approach a useful tool in the investigation on the propagation of infectious diseases. From the theoretical point of view, the present work is one of the few papers in which a nonstandard scheme is fully and rigorously analyzed not only for the dynamical properties, but also for consistently, stability and convergence. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Compartmental epidemiological model; Local stability analysis; Non-standard finite-difference scheme; Positivity preservation; Stability and convergence analysis; Steady-state solutions; Vaccination regime and migration","Computer Simulation; Computers; COVID-19; Epidemiological Models; Humans; Models, Biological; Vaccination; Diseases; MATLAB; Numerical methods; Population dynamics; Stability; Vaccines; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Compartmental epidemiological model; Convergence analysis; Epidemiological modeling; Finite difference scheme; Local stability analysis; Non-standard finite-difference scheme; Non-standard finite-differences; Positivity preservation; Stability analyze; Stability and convergence; Steady state solution; Vaccination regime and migration; Article; computer model; computer simulation; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis software; disease free survival; endemic disease; epidemiological model; human; mathematical model; population migration; population research; steady state; theoretical study; vaccination; biological model; computer; epidemiology; prevention and control; vaccination; Finite difference method","","","","","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT, (A1-S-45928)","One of the authors (J.E.M.-D.) was funded by the National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico through grant A1-S-45928.

In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted via telephone and Zoom with social service providers. (n = 28) who provided direct services to immigrant clients in Los Angeles, CA. Colaizzi’s (1978) phenomenological method was utilized as a data analysis guide. Findings showed that Latinx immigrants experienced: (a) high rates of economic stressors and negative mental health outcomes due to the pandemic; (b) immigration-related distress and barriers seeking services; (c) shifting social service needs; and (d) relied on spiritual practices and mutual aid. Culturally responsive practice and policy implications are included. Future research recommendations include addressing the importance of enhancing relationships with immigrant-based centers and faith-based agencies to assist practitioners in serving more immigrant families to restore their physical, mental, and emotional well-being and prevent child welfare systems involvement. Policy recommendations are provided to encourage effective, culturally responsive innovations and adaptations to improve service provision and policy changes to best optimize the health of immigrant communities. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","COVID-19; immigration enforcement; Latinx immigrants; social service needs; spirituality","","","","","","","","(2012); The “migrant protection protocols.”, (2021); Androff D.K., Ayon C., Becerra D., Gurrola M., Salas L., Krysik J., Gerdes K., Segal E., US immigration policy and immigrant children’s well-being: The impact of policy shifts, The Journal of Sociology & Social Welfare, 38, 1, pp. 77-98, (2011); Ayon C., Service needs among Latino immigrant families: Implications for social work practice, Social Work, 59, 1, pp. 13-23, (2014); Ayon C., Ojeda I., Ruano E., Cultural socialization practices among Latino immigrant families within a restrictive immigration socio-political context, Children and Youth Services Review, 88, pp. 57-65, (2018); Barajas-Gonzalez R.G., Ayon C., Torres F., Applying a community violence framework to understand the impact of immigration enforcement threat on Latino children, Social Policy Report, 31, 3, pp. 1-24, (2018); Berg B., Qualitative research methods for the social sciences, (1988); Bernstein H., Gonzalez D., Karpman M., Zuckerman S., (2020); Brabeck K., Xu Q., The impact of detention and deportation on Latino immigrant children and families: A quantitative exploration, Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences, 32, 3, pp. 341-361, (2010); (2021); Capps R., Castaneda R.M., Chaudry A., Santos R., (2007); Capps K., Bloomberg City Lab, (2017); Capps R., Gelatt J., Ruiz Soto A.G., Van Hook J., (2020); Risk for COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death by race/ethnicity.

Using the frequency of archaeological radiocarbon dates as a proxy for population size, past changes in population were estimated and quantitatively examined in relation to reconstructions of temperature and sea ice conditions. This analysis was conducted across three spatial scales in order to better identify potential climate impacts on population size: the entire area, four major cultural-environmental regions and sixteen sub-regions. The timing of initial settlement differed by region, and population size fluctuated through time, but there was nevertheless an overall, accelerating increase in most areas. There was a high correspondence between millennial and centennial-scale climate variability and paleodemographic changes across the region, with population size generally increasing during warmer periods and decreasing during cooling episodes. Late Holocene cooling (neoglaciation) triggered a nearly-synchronous population decline across the entire region at 3.9 ka, a time when significant societal disruptions have been identified around the world, and are here shown in the Arctic. Decreasing temperatures and increased sea ice coverage also influenced large-scale migration patterns of Paleo-Inuit peoples as well as their cultural evolution. The growth of Paleo-Inuit populations after 3 ka during continued climate cooling is consistent with archaeological evidence suggesting Paleo-Inuit technological change enabled adaptations to increased sea ice. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","4.2 ka; Archaeology; Data analysis; Greenland; Holocene; Neoglaciation; North America; Paleoclimatology; Paleodemography; Paleoecology","Arctic; Greenland; North America; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Sea ice; Climate variability; Cultural evolution; Environmental fluctuations; Holocene climate variability; Initial settlement; Migration patterns; Population decline; Technological change; archaeological evidence; climate effect; climate variation; cooling; Holocene; ice cover; population decline; population dynamics; population size; radiocarbon dating; sea ice; subarctic region; Climate change","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","We thank A.

In order to accurately identify the urban centers of the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), this study firstly fused nighttime light data, POI data, and population migration data based on wavelet transform, then identified the polycentric spatial structure of the GBA by carrying out cluster and outlier analysis, and evaluated the level of different urban centers byconducting geographical weighted regression analysis. Using data fusion, we identified 4579.81 km² of the urban poly-center area in the GBA, with an identification accuracy of 93.22%. Although the number and spatial extent of the identified urban poly-centers are consistent with the GBA development plan outline, the poly-center level evaluation results are inconsistent with the development plan, which shows there are great differences in actual development levels among different cities in the GBA. By identifying and grading the polycentric spatial structure of the GBA, this study accurately analyzed the current spatial distribution and could provide policy implications for the GBA’s future development and planning. © 2022 by the authors.

In addition, the development of a model of human evolution that can best explain neutral genetic diversity is required to identify confidently regions of the human genome that have been targeted by natural selection. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have resequenced 20 independent noncoding autosomal regions dispersed throughout the genome in 213 individuals from different continental populations, corresponding to a total of, ∼6 Mb of diploid resequencing data. We used these data to explore and co-estimate an extensive range of historical and demographic parameters with a statistical framework that combines the evaluation of multiple models of human evolution via a best-fit approach, followed by an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) analysis. From a methodological standpoint, evaluating the accuracy of the parameter co-estimation allowed us to identify the most accurate set of statistics to be used for the estimation of each of the different historical and demographic parameters characterizing recent human evolution. Conclusions/Significance: Our results support a model in which modern humans left Africa through a single major dispersal event occurring, ∼60,000 years ago, corresponding to a drastic reduction of, ∼5 times the effective population size of the ancestral African population of, ∼13,800 individuals. Subsequently, the ancestors of modern Europeans and East Asians diverged much later, ∼22,500 years ago, from the population of ancestral migrants. This late diversification of Eurasians after the African exodus points to the occurrence of a long maturation phase in which the ancestral Eurasian population was not yet diversified. © 2010 Laval et al.","","Africa; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Bayes Theorem; Biological Evolution; Emigration and Immigration; European Continental Ancestry Group; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome, Human; History; History, Ancient; Humans; Population Dynamics; RNA, Untranslated; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA; untranslated RNA; accuracy; Africa; article; autosome; bottleneck population; data analysis; demography; diploidy; east asian; ethnicity; European; evolution; gene frequency; gene resequencing; gene sequence; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; haplotype; human; human experiment; human genome; normal human; population differentiation; population dispersion; population migration; population size; Sub Saharan African; Asian; Bayes theorem; Caucasian; DNA sequence; genetic selection; genetic variability; genetics; history; migration; population dynamics; population genetics","","RNA, Untranslated, ","","","","","Cavalli-Sforza L.L., Menozzi P., Piazza A., The History and Geography of Human Genes, (1994); Excoffier L., Human demographic history: Refining the recent African origin model, Curr Opin Genet Dev, 12, pp. 675-682, (2002); Garrigan D., Hammer M.F., Reconstructing human origins in the genomic era, Nat Rev Genet, 7, pp. 669-680, (2006); Harpending H.C., Batzer M.A., Gurven M., Jorde L.B., Rogers A.R., Et al., Genetic traces of ancient demography, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 95, pp. 1961-1967, (1998); Stringer C.B., The emergence of modern humans, Sci Am, 263, pp. 98-104, (1990); Stringer C.B., Andrews P., Genetic and fossil evidence for the origin of modern humans, Science, 239, pp. 1263-1268, (1988); Mellars P., Why did modern human populations disperse from Africa ca. 60,000 years ago?

They represent a population's travel demand (number of trips between two zones) and are considered as the step two of a four-step model of transportation planning process. The research community has already recognized that ODM obtained from different sources might differ and have proposed several assessment methods in order to determine the difference among them. Besides a literature review, this research will provide a methodology for the analysis of similarity of ODMs generated from telecom big data sets compared to those obtained using other measurements. To test and validate the proposed methodology, ODM has been created using telecom big data analytics, where a significant number of anonymized telecom user locations have been analyzed to determine a travel demand. The travel demand characteristic for the same area and the same period of time has in parallel been determined/measured using 'the traditional' methodology resulting in the second data set.

Rural land, as a form of insurance and welfare, can handle random hazards, and the new Land Management Law guarantees that rural migrants who settle in the city can maintain their rights to farmland, homesteads, and a collective income distribution. Existing studies have pointed out that homeland tenure can reduce migrants’ urban settlement intentions (which is a self-reported subjective perception of city life). However, little is known about how the rural-urban circularity and rural tenure system (especially for those still holding hometown lands in the countryside) affect rural migrants’ temporary urban settlements (especially for those preferring to stay in informal communities in the host city). The existing studies on the urban villages in China have focused only on the side of the receiving cities, but have rarely mentioned the other side of this process, focusing on migrants’ rural land tenure issues in their hometowns. This study discusses the rationale of informality (the urban village) and attests to whether, and to what extent, rural migrants’ retention of their hometown lands can affect their tenure security choices (urban village or not) in Chinese metropolises such as Beijing. Binary logistic regression was conducted and the data analysis proved that rural migrants who kept their hometown lands, compared to their land-loss counterparts, were more likely to live in a Beijing urban village. This displays the resilience and circularity of rural-urban migration in China, wherein the rural migrant households demonstrate the “micro-family economy”, maintaining tenure security in their hometown and avoiding the dissipation of their family income in their destination. The Discussion and Conclusions sections of this paper refer to some policy implications related to maintaining the rural-urban dual system, protecting rural migrant land rights, and beefing up the “opportunity structure” (including maintaining the low-rent areas in metropolises such as Beijing) in the 14th Five Year Plan period. © 2021 by the authors.

Since 2012, California has experienced a record-setting drought, and multiple studies predict drought conditions currently underway will persist and even increase in severity. Recent declines and local extinctions of California newt populations in Santa Monica Mountain streams motivate our study of the impact of drought on newt population sizes. Although newts are terrestrial salamanders, they migrate to streams each spring to breed and lay eggs. Since egg and larval stages occur in water, a precipitation deficit due to drought conditions reduces the space for newt egg-laying and the necessary habitat for larval development. To mathematically forecast newt population dynamics, we develop a nonlinear system of discrete equations that includes demographic parameters such as survival rates for newt life stages and egg production, which depend on habitat availability and rainfall. We estimate these demographic parameters using 15 years of stream survey data collected from Cold Creek in Los Angeles County, California, and our model captures the observed decline of the parameterized Cold Creek newt population. Based upon data analysis, we predict how the number of available newt egg-laying sites varies with annual precipitation. Our model allows us to make predictions about how the length and severity of drought can affect the likelihood of persistence and the time to critical endangerment of a local newt population. We predict that sustained severe drought will critically endanger the newt population but that the newt population can rebound if a drought is sufficiently short. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Amphibian decline; Discrete mathematical model; Drought; Taricha torosa","Animal Migration; Animals; California; Female; Larva; Male; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics; Salamandridae; California; Coast Ranges; Los Angeles County; Santa Monica Mountains; United States; Amphibia; Salamandridae; Salamandroidea; Taricha torosa; rain; amphibian; drought; larval development; numerical model; population decline; population dynamics; population size; adult; Article; California; drought; egg laying; egg production; female; field study; habitat; juvenile animal; life cycle stage; mathematical model; nonhuman; nonlinear system; population dynamics; priority journal; Salamandridae; simulation; species extinction; spring; summer; survival rate; Taricha torosa; animal; biological model; larva; male; physiology; population dynamics; population migration; Salamandridae","","","","","Natural Science Division of Pepperdine University; National Science Foundation, NSF, (-1062721); Pepperdine University","We would like to acknowledge Gary Bucciarelli for providing mark-recapture data estimates based on 20 years of data.

However, little is known about the effect of rural-urban migration on fertilizer use when left-behind women assume key decision-maker roles. This study highlights the effect of left-behind women on fertilizer use, drawing on nationwide household survey data in China. The results indicate that households with recognized left-behind women heads use less fertilizer than those with recognized men heads, while households with de facto left-behind women heads use more fertilizer. Moreover, the average nexus between households with recognized left-behind women heads whose major agricultural income comes from grain crops and fertilize use is negative but small in size and statistically insignificant. The findings indicate that future policy efforts aimed at decreasing rural environmental degradation should place greater emphasis on left-behind women’s empowerment in socioeconomic decision-making within and outside the household, thereby contributing to an environment in which left-behind women farmers can succeed in a sustainable way. © 2022 by the author.","China; fertilizer use; left-behind women; rural-urban migration; smallholder households","China; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Family Characteristics; Female; Fertilizers; Humans; Male; Population Dynamics; Rural Population; China; fertilizer; developing world; empowerment; fertilizer application; household survey; rural-urban migration; smallholder; womens status; adult; agricultural worker; agriculture; Article; China; controlled study; crop; data analysis; developing country; economic decision making; empowerment; environmental policy; family decision making; female; female by occupation; geographic distribution; grain; household; household income; human; left behind woman farmer; migration; rural area; rural urban migration; smallholder household; urban area; China; demography; economics; family size; male; population dynamics; rural population","","Fertilizers, ","","","Pearl River Talents Plan, (20170133); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (20YJCZH144); Government of Guangdong Province; Guangzhou Science and Technology Program key projects, (202102020926); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2019A1515010884)","This study was funded by the Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou (202102020926), the Humanities and Social Sciences Project from the Ministry of Education of China (20YJCZH144), the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2019A1515010884), and Guangdong Province through the Pearl River Talents Plan (20170133).","Ge D., Long H., Qiao W., Wang Z., Sun D., Yang R., Effects of rural–urban migration on agricultural transformation: A case of Yucheng City, China, J.

Tencent Migration big data can fully, dynamically, immediately, and visually record a population migration trajectory with location-based service (LBS) technology. Through the Tencent Migration data platform, data on daily population floating among 346 cities in China during the 2018 Spring Festival travel rush (SFTR) are obtained. The characteristics and spatial pattern of population flow among cities are analyzed from the perspectives of the population flow distribution level, hierarchical aggregation of the distributed network system, population flow spatial patterns, and network characteristics. Three-hundred forty-six cities were divided into nine communities. The results are as follows: the net inflow routes of the population in the three periods all show a diamond-shaped skeleton supported by a cross-shaped one. The population distribution centers are mainly concentrated in the four major urban agglomerations. The clear hierarchical structure and level distinction of population distribution centers can be identified, and there is a positive correlation between the level of city administrative and the influence of population floating. Population flows of most cities are in a relatively balanced state. The degree of urban network nodes is the power-law distribution, so the network is scale free, and the network has small-world characteristic. It provides a new perspective for the study of population mobility and urban network. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Population flow; Spring Festival travel rush; Tencent migration; Urban network","China; Big data; Data visualization; Location based services; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Telecommunication services; Warehouses; Distributed network systems; Hierarchical aggregation; Hierarchical structures; Network characteristics; Positive correlations; Power law distribution; Structural characteristics; Urban agglomerations; administrative system; network analysis; spatial analysis; trajectory; travel behavior; urban development; urban planning; urban population; Population distribution","","","","","Scientific Research Fund for the Provincial Universities of Gansu, (2016A-001); Northwest Normal University, NWNU; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41661025)","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41661025), the Scientific Research Fund for the Provincial Universities of Gansu (No. 2016A-001), and Research Capacity Promotion Program for Young Teachers of Northwest Normal University (No. NWNU-LKQN-16-7).

Length frequency data were collected from April to October 2004 from the main commercial (hilsa) landings at Thatta, Sindh. Estimated parameters of the von Bertalanffy (Hum. Biol. 10, 181-213) growth model were L∞ = 31.5 cm, K = 1.5 year-1, t0 = -0.10 year as obtained by the electronic length frequency analysis (ELEFAN I). Estimated natural, fishing, and total mortalities were 2.21, 0.673, 2.89 year-1, respectively. The relative biomass per recruit (B′/R) was 0.95 and yield per recruit (Y′/R) was 0.06 using the knife-edge selection. The exploitation ratio at the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was Emax = 1.0 year-1, fishing mortality at MSY was Fmax = 2.89 year-1, average target Fopt = 0.5 year-1 and Flimit = 1.47 year-1. The catch and effort data from 1981 to 2004 (MFD, Karachi) were analyzed using the catch and effort data analysis (CEDA) computer programme. Estimated biological reference point of MSY for the Fox model was 891 tonnes (t), R2 = 0.75; for the Schaefer and Pella-Tomlinson models MSY = 744 t, R2 = 0.49, the outputs of which appeared to be more conservative than the Fox model which indicated a better fit. The overall situation of hilsa fishery is in severe stress and appears vulnerable to overexploitation. On the basis of the present findings, serious attention is required to provide appropriate access of the fish to the Indus River during the spawning period as well as to impose a ban on fishing during upstream migration and on undersized catch to prevent this traditional fishery in this area. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","","Hilsa; Tenualosa ilisha","","","","","","","von Bertalanffy L., A quantitative theory of organic growth (Inquiries on Growth Laws II), Hum.

Traditionally, sea turtle individuals are identified through the application of external flipper tags and/or internal passive integrated transponders (PITs). However, sea turtle identification and consequently population studies are hampered by the loss of external flipper tags and migration of PITs. In this study, we assessed the accuracy and time efficiency of the Interactive Individual Identification System software (I3S Pattern v. 4.02) to photo-identify facial patterns of immature captured and free-swimming green turtles Chelonia mydas and hawksbill turtles Eretmochelys imbricata. Using a library of 436 photos representing 189 sea turtle individuals, we evaluated the accuracy and time taken for I3S Pattern to match individuals. A high proportion of individuals were successfully identified from photographs taken of captured turtles (97%) and free-swimming turtles (85%). I3S reduced data analysis time by 80% when compared to the visual assessment of photos, and is further optimised when photographs are of increased quality. These results demonstrate that I3S has great potential to contribute to population studies and management plans by facilitating both specialised research and citizen science programmes. © Inter-Research 2018.","Interactive Individual Identification System; Mark?recapture studies; Photo-identification; Sea turtles; Wildlife recognition software","Chelonia mydas; Cheloniidae; Eretmochelys imbricata; Testudines; accuracy assessment; efficiency measurement; identification method; individual variation; mark-recapture method; photograph; software; statistical analysis; temporal variation; turtle","","","","","","","Araujo G., Montgomery J., Pahang K., Labaja J., Murray R., Ponzo A., Using minimally invasive techniques to determine green sea turtle Chelonia mydas life-history parameters, J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 483, pp. 25-30, (2016); Carpentier A.S., Jean C., Barret M., Chassagneux A., Ciccione S., Stability of facial scale patterns on green sea turtles Chelonia mydas over time: A validation for the use of a photo-identification method, J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 476, pp. 15-21, (2016); Carter S.J.B., Bell I.P., Miller J.J., Gash P.P., Automated marine turtle photograph identification using artificial neural networks, with application to green turtles, J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 452, pp. 105-110, (2014); Conrad C.C., Hilchey K.G., A review of citizen science and community-based environmental monitoring: Issues and opportunities, Environ Monit Assess, 176, pp. 273-291, (2011); Den Hartog J., Reijns R., S Pattern Manual — Interactive Individual Identification System, (2014); Dunbar S.G., Ito H.E., Bahjri K., Dehom S., Salinas L., Recognition of juvenile hawksbills Eretmochelys imbricata through face scale digitization and automated searching, Endang Species Res, 26, pp. 137-146, (2014); Dutton D.L., Dutton P.H., Chaloupka M., Boulon R.H., Increase of a Caribbean leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea nesting population linked to long-term nest protection, Biol Conserv, 126, pp. 186-194, (2005); Gheorghiu C., Hanna J., Smith J.W., Smith D.S., Wilkie M.P., Encapsulation and migration of PIT tags implanted in brown trout (Salmo trutta L.), Aquaculture, 298, pp. 350-353, (2010); Jean C., Ciccione S., Talma E., Ballorain K., Bourjea J., Photo-identification method for green and hawksbill turtles — First results from Reunion, Indian Ocean Turtle Newsl, 11, pp. 8-13, (2010); Lloyd J.R., Maldonado M.A., Stafford R., Methods of developing user-friendly keys to identify green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas L.) from photographs, Int J Zool, 2012, pp. 1-7, (2012); Makowski C., Seminoff J.A., Salmon M., Home range and habitat use of juvenile Atlantic green turtles (Chelonia mydas L.) on shallow reef habitats in Palm Beach, Florida, USA, Mar Biol, 148, pp. 1167-1179, (2006); Meekan M.G., Bradshaw C.J.A., Press M., McLean C., Richards A., Quasnichka S., Taylor J.G., Population size and structure of whale sharks Rhincodon typus at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia, Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 319, pp. 275-285, (2006); Pritchard P.C.H., Taxonomy, external morphology, and species identification, Research and Management Techniques for The Conservation of Sea Turtles, pp. 11-13, (1999); Reisser J., Proietti M., Kinas P., Sazima I., Photographic identification of sea turtles: Method description and validation, with an estimation of tag loss, Endang Species Res, 5, pp. 73-82, (2008); Rocha R., Carrilho T., Rebelo R., Iris photo-identification: A new methodology for the individual recognition of Tarentola geckos, Amphib-Reptil, 34, pp. 590-596, (2013); Schofield G., Katselidis K.A., Dimopoulos P., Pantis J.D., Investigating the viability of photo-identification as an objective tool to study endangered sea turtle populations, J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 360, pp. 103-108, (2008); Schofield G., Katselidis K.A., Lilley M.K.S., Reina R., Hays G., Detecting elusive aspects of wildlife ecology using drones: New insights on the mating dynamics and operational sex ratios of sea turtles, Funct Ecol, 31, pp. 2310-2319, (2017); Speed C.W., An Information-Theoretic Assessment of Spot-Pattern Matching Software and Its Application to Population Estimates of Whale Sharks (Rhincodon Typus), (2006); Speed C.W., Meekan M.G., Bradshaw C.J., Spot the match — Wildlife photo-identification using information theory, Front Zool, 4, (2007); Thompson P.M., Wilson B., Grellier K., Hammond P.S., Combining power analysis and population viability analysis to compare traditional and precautionary approaches to conservation of coastal cetaceans, Conserv Biol, 14, pp. 1253-1263, (2000); Waayers D.A., A Holistic Approach to Planning for Wildlife Tourism: A Case Study of Marine Turtle Tourism and Conservation in The Ningaloo Region, Western Australia, (2010); Wood L.D., Hardy R., Meylan P.A., Meylan A.B., Characterization of a hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) foraging aggregation in a high-latitude reef community in southeastern Florida, USA, Herpetol Conserv Biol, 8, pp. 258-275, (2013)","B.

Mobility provides freedom to patients to obtain health care from providers across regions and even countries. It is essential to monitor patient choices in order to maintain the quality standards and responsiveness of the health system, otherwise, the health system may suffer from geographic disparities in the accessibility to quality and responsive health care. In this article, we study patient mobility in a national health care system to identify medical regions, spatio-temporal and service characteristics of health care utilization, and demands for patient mobility. Methods: We conducted a systematic analysis of province-to-province patient mobility in Turkey from December 2009 to December 2013, which was derived from 1.2 billion health service records. We first used a flow-based regionalization method to discover functional medical regions from the patient mobility network. We compare the results of data-driven regions to designated regions of the government in order to identify the areas of mismatch between planned regional service delivery and the observed utilization in the form of patient flows. Second, we used feature selection, and multivariate flow clustering to identify spatio-temporal characteristics and health care needs of patients on the move. Results: Medical regions we derived by analyzing the patient mobility data showed strong overlap with the designated regions of the Ministry of Health. We also identified a number of regions that the regional service utilization did not match the planned service delivery. Overall, our spatio-temporal and multivariate analysis of regional and long-distance patient flows revealed strong relationship with socio-demographic and cultural structure of the society and migration patterns. Also, patient flows exhibited seasonal patterns, and yearly trends which correlate with implemented policies throughout the period. We found that policies resulted in different outcomes across the country. We also identified characteristics of long-distance flows which could help inform policy-making by assessing the needs of patients in terms of medical specialization, service level and type. Conclusions: Our approach helped identify (1) the mismatch between regional policy and practice in health care utilization (2) spatial, temporal, health service level characteristics and medical specialties that patients seek out by traveling longer distances. Our findings can help identify the imbalance between supply and demand, changes in mobility behaviors, and inform policy-making with insights. © 2018 The Author(s).","Flow mapping; Health care; Patient mobility;

The ancestry inferred from surname information can be a useful means to understand the dynamics of human populations. This knowledge allows us to characterize geographically the ethnicity of populations, and to understand the complex relationships between identity, migration, and health issues in a demographic view. However, in most cases, a detailed geolocalization of this data can be a daunting task. We propose a visual analytic tool that summarizes the heterogeneous surname and geographic information collected from Argentinean electoral rolls. This tool allows a massive data analysis, and facilitates interdisciplinary studies about population dynamics related to ancestry, migration, and health. It also offers an easy-to-use interface that allows interactive exploration of isonymy and surname origins, their distribution, and spatial trends in a high population density context.  © 1981-2012 IEEE.","","Ethnicity; Humans; Names; Population Dynamics; Health; Job analysis; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Visualization; Complex relationships; Distribution patterns; Human biology; Human population; Interactive visual analysis; Market researches; Pattern identification; Spatial patterns; Standing problems; Task analysis; ethnicity; human; nomenclature; population dynamics; Population statistics","","","","","","","Albeck M.E., Alfaro E.L., Dipierri J.E., Chaves E.R., Los apellidos de salta en el siglo xxi:Origen geo-lingüístico, diversidad y frecuencia, Andes, 2, 28, pp. 1-20, (2017); Bangor A., Kortum P., Miller J., Determining what individual SUS scores mean: Adding an adjective rating scale, J.

Such genealogical datasets provide a great opportunity for social science analysts, historians, and the public to study a wide variety of topics in demography, family and household, kinship, stratification, and health. Nevertheless, the large scale and characteristics of the data such as hierarchical, spatiotemporal, and multidimensional also pose special challenges for effective data analysis. In this paper, we introduce GenealogyVis, a visual analytic system to analyze family history and evolution by using the China Multigenerational Panel Dataset-Liaoning, which has more than 1.5 million observations and provides socioeconomic, demographic, and other information for more than 260 000 residents, and further enable users to explore the correlation between the development of families and the social context of environments, economics, policies, and so on. This system includes five main linked views: the Scatter-plot View to provide an overview of the data and further explore the correlation analysis, the Tree View to show the family structure and details for individuals, the Migration View to present the genealogical migratory behaviors, the Matrix View to analyze the reproduction pattern between two generations, and the Stream View to show various statistical information such as demographic information and temporal information. A design study was conducted with a research group led by a domain expert of humanities and social sciences in an iterative manner over half a year. Several in-depth case studies, involving the research group, are described to demonstrate the usefulness of GenealogyVis and discuss new findings. © 2013 IEEE.","Family trees; genealogy visualization; interaction","Behavioral research; Economics; History; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Social sciences; Correlation analysis; Demographic information; Family structure; Humanities and social science; Migratory behaviors; Reproduction pattern; Statistical information; Temporal information; Trees (mathematics)","","","","","","","Keller K., Reddy P., Sachdeva S., Family Tree Visualization, (2011); McGuffin M.J., Balakrishnan R., Interactive visualization of genealogical graphs, Proc.

Pairing origin and destination states and controlling for a rich structure of fixed effects, we find that income positively impacts migration outflows, especially for Mexican states of origin with a recent migration history and for low-educated migrant flows, suggesting the existence of credit constraints. We find evidence that drought causes more out-migration, while other climatic shocks have no effect. Violence is found to increase out-migration flows from border states and to decrease migration from other Mexican states, especially where violence is directed at migrants. Last, return flows are larger when income growth at destination is lower, consistent with the accumulation of savings as a primary motivation of migrants. Exploring the impact of the crisis, we find evidence of significant changes in the geography of migration flows. Traditional flows are drying up, and new migration corridors are rising, with implications on the composition of the Mexican population in the United States. Although the effect of income on flows in both directions is unchanged by the crisis, the negative effect of violence on out-migration tends to reverse at the end of the period. Overall, this study emphasizes the interest of analyzing disaggregated flows at the infra-country level. © 2016, Population Association of America.","Gravity equation; International migration; Mexico; Mexico-U.S. migration; Return migration","Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Humans; Income; Mexico; Population Dynamics; United States; Violence; Weather; employment; human; income; Mexico; migration; population dynamics; statistics and numerical data; United States; violence; weather","","","","","6th Edition of the Summer School in Development Economics, University of Salerno; Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center; Office of Earth Sciences; University of Cergy-Pontoise, (ANR11-LBX-0023-01); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; National Space Development Agency of Japan, NASDA","Funding text 1: We thank the Editors and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

Firstly, absolute dominant trip distance and relative dominant trip distance were proposed to define dominant trip distance. Then two types of the dominant trip distance model for urban external passenger transport mode were developed respectively. Finally, using the big data of population migration, the passenger transport mode share curve based on trip distance was drawn, and the dominant trip distance model was solved. The results show that in recent years, the absolute dominant trip distances of highway, railway and airway passenger transport modes are [8, 119] km, [119, 1 594] km and [1 594, 3 000] km respectively, while the relative dominant trip distances are [8, 463] km, [318, 983] km and [2 477, 3 000] km respectively.

Based on Tencent migration data of 2018, this study compares different intercity mobility patterns among different holidays and identifies the influencing factors using spatial and statistical analysis methods. The holidays consist of traditional holidays (Spring Festival, Tomb-sweeping Day, Dragon Boat Festival, and Mid-Autumn Festival) and non-traditional holidays (New Year’s Day, May Day and National Day). The results are demonstrated below: 1) The spatial patterns of intercity mobility vary markedly from non-traditional holidays to traditional holidays, directly reflected in the distribution of main destination cities. 2) Regional attributes, including administrative divisions, geographical divisions, and dialect divisions, do affect the intercity mobility patterns in different holidays, and people in the south are more inclined to travel on traditional holidays and pay more attention to traditions; 3) Various travel purposes, distances and scales emerge in different holidays; 4) Economic factors at the city level are more associated with working place selections, and the destination choices during non-traditional holidays are influenced more by tourism factors. This comparative study of intercity mobility patterns among holidays has significant policy implications for allocating transportation resources and optimizing city hierarchical structure. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Different holidays; Influencing factors; Intercity mobility; Spatial patterns; Tencent migration data","China; economic development; population distribution; resource allocation; social mobility; statistical analysis; transportation development","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42101226)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.42101226).

For instance, in November 2013 NASA announced the release of hundreds of Terabytes of its earth remote sensing dataset. Such data includes but not limited to: weather maps, socioeconomic data, vegetation indices, geological maps, and more. Making sense of such spatial data will be beneficial for several applications that may transform science and society - For example: (1) Space Science: that allows astronomers to study and probably discover new features of both the earth and the outer space, (2) Socio-Economic Analysis: that includes for example climate change analysis, study of deforestation, population migration, and variation in sea levels, (3) Urban Planning: assisting government in city planning, road network design, and transportation engineering, (4) Disaster Planning: that helps in assessing the impact of natural disasters. The main aim of this paper is to investigate novel data management techniques that enable interactive and scalable exploration of big spatial data. The paper envisions novel system architectures that provide support for interactive and spatial data exploration, as follows: (1) The paper suggests extending data analytics frameworks, e.g., Apache Spark, to support spatial data types and operations at scale. The resulting framework will serve as a scalable backbone for processing spatial data exploration tasks. (2) It also sketches novel structures and algorithms that leverage modern hardware, e.g., SSDs, and in-memory data processing techniques to efficiently store and access spatial data. Second, the paper proposes extending spatial database systems to support an exploration-aware spatial query evaluation paradigm through three novel components: (1) Spatial Query Steering: that allows the user to slightly modify the query conditions online (zooming in/out) and retrieve the new results in very low latency. (2) Recommendation-Aware Spatial Querying: that injects the recommendation functionality inside classical spatial query executors to support spatial data recommendation. It leverages recommendation algorithms to predict what spatial objects/areas the user would like based on her past interactions with the system. (3) Spatial Query Approximation: That aims at achieving interactive performance by studying the tradeoff between approximate spatial data exploration and query response time. © 2015 IEEE.","Analytics;

Based on the self-rated health data of the older adults from the sixth and seventh national censuses, this paper tried to depict the dynamic evolution of the older adults' health level in urban and rural areas across different provincial-level regions in China from 2010 to 2020 by using exploratory spatial data analysis method. Then this paper built Gravity-GTWR models to explore the temporal and spatial variations in the factors influencing the older adults' health, such as socioeconomic development, population migration, environmental pollution and protection. The main findings were as follows: (1) From 2010 to 2020, the health level of China's older adults increased overall, but the gap between urban and rural areas further expanded. In terms of the health level of the urban older adults, the pattern of ""decreasing along east-middle-west"" tended to be strengthened. As for the health level of the rural older adults, the spatial pattern has transferred from ""decreasing along east-middle-west"" to ""high in the south and low in the north"". (2) Although the role of socioeconomic development was weakened, it was still the primary factor that shaped and altered the spatial pattern. The rural-urban population migration widened the urban-rural gap in the health of older adults. (3) The role of natural environmental background tended to be weakened, while the role of environmental pollution was enhanced. The strengthened environmental protection measures started to exert positive effects on the health level of older adults in urban areas. © 2022, Science Press.

However, data regarding the effects of meteorological factors on its transmission are limited and inconsistent. A mechanism-based parameterisation scheme was developed to investigate the association between the scaled transmission rate (STR) of COVID-19 and the meteorological parameters in 20 provinces/municipalities located on the plains in China. We obtained information on the scale of population migrated from Wuhan, the world epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak, into the study provinces/municipalities using mobile-phone positioning system and big data techniques. The highest STRs were found in densely populated metropolitan areas and in cold provinces located in north-eastern China. Population density had a non-linear relationship with disease spread (linearity index, 0.9). Among various meteorological factors, only temperature was significantly associated with the STR after controlling for the effect of population density. A negative and exponential relationship was identified between the transmission rate and the temperature (correlation coefficient, −0.56; 99% confidence level). The STR increased substantially as the temperature in north-eastern China decreased below 0 °C (the STR ranged from 3.5 to 12.3 when the temperature was between −9.41 °C and −13.87 °C), whilst the STR showed less temperature dependence in the study areas with temperate weather conditions (the STR was 1.21 ± 0.57 when the temperature was above 0 °C). Therefore, a higher population density was linearly whereas a lower temperature (<0 °C) was exponentially associated with an increased transmission rate of COVID-19. These findings suggest that the mitigation of COVID-19 spread in densely populated and/or cold regions will be a great challenge. © 2020","COVID-19; Imported scale; Meteorology; Population density; Temperature","Betacoronavirus; China; Cities; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Meteorological Concepts; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; China; Hubei; Wuhan; Coronavirus; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Temperature distribution; Transmissions; Correlation coefficient; Meteorological factors; Meteorological parameters; Mobile phone positioning; Non-linear relationships; Population densities; Temperature dependence; Transmission rates; air temperature; COVID-19; disease spread; disease transmission; meteorology; metropolitan area; parameterization; population density; viral disease; Article; big data; China; cold exposure; coronavirus disease 2019; correlation coefficient; environmental parameters; global positioning system; human; mechanism based parameterisation scheme; meteorological phenomena; nonlinear system; pandemic; population density; population migration; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; temperature; urban area; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; city; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; meteorological phenomena; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Population statistics","","","","","Baidu Inc.; CSSE; Environmental Central Facility; Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering; RGC, (N_HKUST638/19); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong Government, (T24/504/17); Gund Institute for Environment; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HKUST","Funding text 1: This work was supported by NSFC / RGC (Grant No. N_HKUST638/19 ) and the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong Government (Project No. T24/504/17).

These changes need to be accompanied by appropriate government responses. We examined these changing mobilities in Bangladesh by first classifying them according to the relevant characteristics of emergency mobilities as described by Adey (anticipation, coordination, absence and difference) and then applying, as appropriate, one or more of Sheller and Urry’s six essential bodies of mobility theory to provide a dynamic analysis from which to generate policy responses. Major findings specific to Bangladesh include the criticality of social networks and the mobility of gender roles due to flood-related migration. The policy implications, situated at the confluence of cultural tradition, the imperative to survive and current government policy which does not encourage mobility, focus on reconceptualising the use of land space to envisage a new paradigm of support for emergency mobility and resourcing people movement. Future research could apply this novel data analysis approach to other migration situations, with the purpose of informing emergency mobility policy. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bangladesh; Disaster; emergency; flooding; gender; mobility","Bangladesh; climate change; conceptual framework; disaster management; flood; flooding; gender role; mobility; natural disaster","","","","","","","Adey P., If Mobility Is Everything Then It Is Nothing: Towards a Relational Politics of (Im)Mobilities, Mobilities, 1, 1, pp. 75-94, (2006); Adey P., Emergency Mobilities, Mobilities, 11, 1, pp. 32-48, (2016); Ahsan R., Kellet J., Karuppannan S., Climate Induced Migration: Lessons from Bangladesh, The International Journal of Climate Change: Impacts and Responses, 5, pp. 1-13, (2014); Andrei S., Firoz R., Anderson S., Internal Migration Can Be a Radical Adaptive Strategy in Bangladesh, Briefing, (2015); Brouwer R., Akter S., Brander L., Haque E., Socio Economic Vulnerability and Adaptation to Environmental Risk: A Case Study of Climate Change and Flooding in Bangladesh, Risk Analysis, 27, 2, pp. 313-326, (2007); Clark N., Geo-Politics and the Disaster of Anthropocene, Disaster Politics: Materials, Experiments, and Preparedness, pp. 17-19, (2014); Cook N., Butz D., Mobility Justice in the Context of Disaster, Mobilities, 11, 3, pp. 400-419, (2016); Custers P., Bangladesh’s Flood Action Plan: A Critique, Economic and Political Weekly, 28, 29-30, pp. 1501-1503, (1993); Etzold B., Mallick B., Moving beyond the Focus on Environmental Migration Towards Recognising the Normality of Translocal Lives: Insights from Bangladesh, Migration, Risk Management and Climate Change: Evidence and Policy Responses, pp. 105-128, (2016); Faulconbridge J., Hui A., Traces of a Mobile Field: Ten Years of Mobilities Research, Mobilities, 11, 1, pp. 1-14, (2016); Gray C.L., Mueller V., Natural Disasters and Population Mobility in Bangladesh, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 109, 16, pp. 6000-6005, (2012); Henrici J., A Gendered Response to Disaster: In the Aftermath of Haiti’s Earthquake, Anthropology News, 51, 7, (2010); Ishtiaque A., Nazem N.I., Household-Level Disaster-Induced Losses and Rural-Urban Migration: Experience from World’s One of the Most Disaster-Affected Countries, Natural Hazards, 86, pp. 315-326, (2017); Islam M.M., Herbeck J., Migration and Translocal Livelihoods of Coastal Small-Scale Fishers in Bangladesh, The Journal of Development Studies, 49, 6, pp. 832-845, (2013); Islam R., Ingham V., Hicks J., Manock I., The Changing Role of Women in Resilience, Recovery and Economic Development at the Intersection of Recurrent Disaster: A Case Study from Sirajgang, Bangladesh, Journal of Asian and African Studies, 52, 1, pp. 50-67, (2017); Islam R., Walkerden G., How Bonding and Bridging Networks Contribute to Disaster Resilience and Recovery on the Bangladeshi Coast, International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 10, pp. 281-291, (2014); Joffe H., Gabriela Perez-Fuentes H.W., Potts W., Rosetto T., How to Increase Earthquake and Home Fire Preparedness: The Fix-It Intervention, Natural Hazards, 84, pp. 1943-1965, (2016); Keeley B., Human Capital, (2007); Mallick B., Vogt J., Population Displacement after Cyclone and Its Consequences: Empirical Evidence from Coastal Bangladesh, Natural Hazards, 73, pp. 191-212, (2014); Martin M., Kang Y.H., Billah M., Siddiqui T., Black R., Kniveton D., Climate-Influenced Migration in Bangladesh: The Need for a Policy Realignment, Development Policy Review, 35, S2, pp. 357-379, (2017); National Plan for Disaster Management (2016-2020), (2017); Parvin G.A., Shimi A.C., Shaw R., Biswas C., Flood in a Changing Climate: The Impact on Livelihood and How the Rural Poor Cope in Bangladesh, Climate, 4, 60, pp. 1-15, (2016); Paul S., Rezaul Islam M., Ultra-Poor Char People’s Rights to Development and Accessibility to Public Services: A Case of Bangladesh, Habitat International, 48, pp. 113-121, (2015); Penning-Rowsell E.C., Sultana P., Thompson P.M., The ‘Last Resort’?

Tencent Migration big data can fully, dynamically, immediately, and visually record the trajectories of population migrations with location- based service technology. Here, the daily population flow data of 346 cities during the Spring Festival travel rush in China were combined with different travel modes to measure the spatial structure and spatial patterns of an intercity trip network of Chinese residents. These data were then used for a comprehensive depiction of the complex relationships between the population flows of cities. The results showed that there were obvious differences in the characteristics of urban networks from the perspective of different modes of travel. The intercity flow of aviation trips showed a core-periphery structure with national hub cities as the core distribution. Trips by train showed a core-periphery structure with cities along the national railway artery as the core. This gradually decreased toward hinterland cities. Moreover, the intercity flow of highway trips indicated a spatial pattern of strong local aggregation that matched the popu lation scale.

In this study we analysed genetic traits of Sus scrofa from 13 regions in Asia (including previously undisclosed Eastern Caucasus and Trans-Baikal regions) using purely wild boar samples. Mitochondrial control region and Y-chromosome genes (AMELY & USP9Y) were employed to resolve phylogeographic relationships. We discussed spatiotemporal dynamics of wild boar distribution and compared molecular data to morphological and cytogenetic data on wild boar variability and taxonomy. A total of 51 haplotypes were detected in mtDNA control region and five haplotypes were found in combined sequences of Y-chromosome genes. The phylogeography of Asia-wide wild boars supported a hypothesis of migration from South-East Asia to South Asia, followed by migration to East and West Asia. We present a hypothesis about independent dispersal of wild boars into West Asia from South and North-East Asia. Mitochondrial DNA phylogeny generally fits the morphologically based intraspecies taxonomy. Distribution of chromosomal variants of wild boar presently does not show clear correlation with mtDNA clades. © 2020 Choi et al.

Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada","Background: While some trained nurses migrate to destination countries to work as domestic workers, little is known about their migration motivations. Aim: This study explores the motivations of Philippine educated nurses who migrated to Canada through the Live-in Caregiver Program from 2001 to 2011 (a Canadian domestic worker programme). Methods: A single case study qualitative methodology and the transnational feminist concept of global care chains were utilized for this study. Interviews of 15 Philippine educated nurses who migrated to Canada as domestic workers were conducted in the province of Ontario, Canada, between February to October 2012. All participants had a baccalaureate degree from the Philippines. Interviews were tape recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using critical discourse analysis, aided by NVIVO 10 data analysis software. Results: Findings reveal a multi-step immigration process in which nurses migrate from the Philippines to the Middle East (especially Saudi Arabia) and finally to Canada. While emigration from the Philippines is mainly economically driven, migration from the Middle East to Canada is primarily motivated by the desire for Canadian citizenship for the family. Also, perceived social status and lifestyle in Canada as compared to the Middle East motivates this group of women to migrate to Canada. Limitation: The major limitation of this study is the lack of input from nursing policy makers. Conclusion: Gender-based familial ideologies and perspective on social status influence the migration decision of this group of nurses. Implications for Nursing and Health Policy: Implications for nursing and health policy makers include the provision of clear pre-migration information (including on the nursing registration process) to internationally educated nurses, advocacy for stronger immigration policies to ensure the integration of internationally educated nurses and a consideration of gender in all health human resource policies. © 2014 International Council of Nurses.","Canada; Case Study; Domestic Workers; Home Care; Immigration; Internationally Educated Nurse; Live-in Caregivers; Nurse Migration; Philippines; Saudi Arabia","Adult; Canada; Emigration and Immigration; Female; Freedom; Home Care Services; Humans; Life Style; Middle Aged; Motivation; Nurses, International; Philippines; Saudi Arabia; Socioeconomic Factors; adult; Canada; female; freedom; home care; human; lifestyle; middle aged; migration; motivation; nurse; Philippines; psychology; Saudi Arabia; socioeconomics","","","","","","","Alexis O., Shillingford A., Internationally recruited neonatal nurses' experiences in the National Health Service in London, International Journal of Nursing Practice, (2014); Alonso-Garbayo A., Maben J., Internationally recruited nurses from India and the Philippines in the United Kingdom: the decision to emigrate, Human Resources for Health, 7, (2009); Blythe J., Baumann A., Rheaume A., McIntosh K., Nurse migration to Canada: pathways and pitfalls to workforce integration, Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 20, 2, pp. 202-210, (2009); Speaking Points for the Honourable Jason Kenney, P.C., M.

The residents' migration, social network, mobile communications and other geographic behavior big data have become an important data source for urban interactive relationship research. ""Baidu Migration"" big data can fully, dynamically, immediately and visually record population migration trajectory with LBS technology. Through collecting population daily flow among 369 cities in China during the period from February 7 to May 16 in 2015 in ""Baidu Migration"" and extracting six periods with ""Quarter average, Spring Festival Transportation (before Festival), Spring Festival Transportation (after Festival), Labor Day, weekends, workdays"", this paper tries to analyze and compare the characteristics and spatial patterns of daily flow among cities from the aspects of ""population daily flow distribution levels, flow distribution layers network aggregation, spatial patterns and its relationship with the 'Hu Huanyong Line' for population flow"". This paper analyzes the characteristics and spatial pattern of population daily flow among cities in each period. The result shows that ""Baidu migration"" big data clearly shows the pattern of population flow between the central and coastal areas in China during the period of Spring Festival Transportation. Main flow assembling centers are distributed in the urban agglomerations of Beijing-Tianjin- Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta and Chengdu-Chongqing, and those centers have strong coherence with those urban hierarchies in each period. Clear hierarchical structure and level distinction can be identified in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, Beijing-Tianjin- Hebei, Chengdu- Chongqing and Urumqi assembling systems in each period. But Central China, Northeast China, Southwest China and coastal Fujian do not present a pattern of higher level of urban assembling centers and high hierarchical assembling systems and those conditions do not match the status in national regional development strategy of those areas. The ""Hu Huanyong Line"" can reflect the spatial patterns of population daily flow at national level, and the profound influence of geographical environment on the population daily flow among cities. The intensity of population flow among cities is an important indicator of intensity of regional economic relationship, urban hierarchy and network structure. Spatial patterns of population flow showed in this paper can provide reference for the formation of the new pattern of regional economic development and the promotion of regional balanced development. © 2016, Science Press.

A major landmark in human-planetary evolution was reached recently with a majority of people now living in cities, and rural-to-urban migration is predicted to continue into the next century. Landscape change associated with exponential population growth poses major challenges to coupled human and natural systems. Although some progress has been made, to date there exist no ideal instrument for achieving sustainability on neither regional nor local scales. Because there is limited applied evidence investigating landscape form (e.g. configuration) and population dynamics (e.g. population density) with measures of sustainability, this research area requires further investigation. Using Human Wellbeing Index (HWI) and Ecosystem Wellbeing Index (EWI) from Robert Prescott-Allens The Wellbeing of Nations: A Country-by-Country Index of Quality of Life and the Environment, a macroscale empirical study was created to further understand sustainable urban development across 33 European countries. Exploratory spatial data analysis was utilized to illustrate Wellbeing clusters across the study area, and spatially enabled regression methods were employed to create regional sustainable urbanization models for explaining Wellbeing indices. With population density, two urban class configuration metrics (e.g. COHESION, PD) were found significant at explaining both HWI and EWI. Between 2000 and 2006, changes in urban morphology and population density were also assessed for 31 of the aforementioned 33 European countries. Findings suggest that conventional urbanization processes will continue to disconnect socioeconomic welfare from life-supporting ecosystem services. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.","applied sustainability science; landscape change; landscape ecology; macroscale ecology; spatial autoregressive modeling; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development planning; urban configuration","Europe; ecosystem service; empirical analysis; landscape change; landscape ecology; quality of life; rural-urban migration; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; sustainable development; urban economy; urbanization; welfare economics","","","","","","","Alberti M., The effects of urban patterns on ecosystem function, Int Reg Sci Rev, 28, pp. 168-192, (2005); Alberti M., Advances in Urban Ecology: Integrating Humans and Ecological Processes in Urban Ecosystems, (2008); Antrop M., Landscape change and the urbanization process in Europe, Landsc Urban Plan, 67, pp. 9-26, (2004); Batty M., The size, scale, and shape of cities, Science, 319, pp. 769-771, (2008); Bini L.M., Diniz-Filho A.F., Rangel T.F.L.V.B., Akre T.S.B., Albaladejo R.G., Albuquerque F.S., Aparicio A., Araujo M.B., Baselga A., Beck J., Et al., Coefficient shifts in geographical ecology: An empirical evaluation of spatial and non-spatial regression, Ecography, 32, pp. 193-204, (2009); Boots B., Local measures of spatial association, Ecoscience, 9, pp. 168-176, (2002); Burnham K.P., Anderson D.R., Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical Information-theoretic Approach. 2nd Ed, (2002); Butchart S.H., Walpole M., Collen B., Van Strien A., Scharlemann J.P.W., Almond R.E.A., Baillie J.E.M., Bomhard B., Brown C., Bruno J., Et al., Global biodiversity: Indicators of recent declines, Science, 328, pp. 1164-1168, (2010); Buttner G., Maucha G., The Thematic Accuracy of Corine Land Cover 2000.

This paper constructs a multi-element two-level constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) model to assess technological progress in, and its contribution to, japonica rice production in China. The results show that the speed of technological progress in the production of japonica rice on average was 0.44% per annum in 1985-2013, and technological progress has contributed significantly to the growth of japonica rice production in China. Robustness checks show that the results appear to be sensitive to which sub-sample is used. Labour and some other inputs are found to be significant but negative, especially during the middle sampling period of 1994-2006 and in eastern and western regions. This has important policy implications on the impact of rural-to-urban migration and farmers' human development. © 2018 by the authors.","China's food policy; Japonica rice production; Sustainable food security system; Technological progress; Two-level CES function","China; Japonica; crop production; food policy; food production; food security; panel data; rice; sustainability; technological development","","","","","Education Ministry, (11YJC790172, 14JJD790045, 14YJC790027, 2015M571895); Leading Project of Young and Central-Aged Academic Leaders in Zhejiang Province, (pd2013244); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41201125, 41401642)","The authors wish to thank Michael McAleer, Guo Pei, Bai Junfei, Chen Qihui, Tian Weiming, Shen Yueqin, Yu Kang, and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments and suggestions.

In this study, 1327 valid information from China's 24 provinces and autonomous regions such as Jiangsu, Henan, Shaanxi and so on was collected through random questionnaire survey of farmers, migrant workers, undergraduate students, graduate students and their family members. Basic situation of rural-urban migrants and their family members of purchasing urban housing were filled out by participants' memories or telephone inquiries. Floating characteristics of rural- urban migrants for purchasing urban housing were summarized by data analysis. Furthermore, causes and formation mechanism of floating direction differences were probed into from the perspective of individual or the family by spearman bivariate correlation analysis and multiple classification logistic regression analysis methods. The results show that firstly, few rural-urban migrants purchased urban housing during the 1980s-1990s, whereas migrants of purchasing urban housing have been gradually growing since 2000 and tend to be younger. What's more, migrants of higher education level purchase housing in the cities of larger scale or higher grade in general. Secondly, cities within the province or autonomous region, especially, county-level cities are the main destination of rural- urban migrants purchasing urban housing, and the attraction of town is weak as a whole. It can be seen from the data that the original location of migrants affects the floating orientation of purchasing urban housing, namely, rural households of ordinary township move to the county-level cities and towns nearby, but the households near big cities specially provincial cities prefer to purchase their housing in those higher-level cities. Thirdly, cities and towns of different levels in the eastern provinces, compared with the other regions, take a relatively larger proportion of purchasing housing, and from the whole country, towns take the largest percentage. These indicate there exists the relatively developed regional economy and the urbanization pattern of coordinated development among large, medium and small cities and towns; Rural-urban migrants dispersedly purchase their housing in cities at or above the county level in the central provinces, where the county-level cities and cities of other provinces at prefecture level and above have the largest proportion of purchasing housing among the three regions. The urban housing of rural-urban migrants in the central provinces is decentralized; In the western provinces, migrants who purchase their urban housing in the cities of prefecture level and above account for more than half, and the proportion of migrants flowing to towns by purchasing housing is the lowest among the three regions. These reflect that it is still underdeveloped and unbalanced inside. Finally, it should say that it is the interaction between the urban and rural demand, the interference of other cities and the distance to the city that influence spatial distribution of migrants for purchasing urban housing. Moreover, the desired economic income and the attraction of the city should be the underlying causes that migrants purchase the urban housing in the cities they work. People prefer to choose the housing in the county-level cities and towns of their hometown or the higher levels of cities nearby if they do not have the stable work in the cities. Through the quantitative analysis we also found that the floating differentiation between migrants for purchasing urban housing is significantly correlated with the personal or family factors such as education degree, fixed job or not, work in the city of purchasing the housing or not, work time in the current city, the age of buyers, and so on. In a word, the social environment and policy implications at the macro level, all media's role of the urban and rural system at the middle level and the subjective behavior of individual or family members at the micro level comprehensively drive the spatial differentiation of rural-urban migrants. © 2016, Science Press.

The study aims at analyzing the ""pull"" forces of Yiwu City and developing migration models for understanding determinants factors of population migration/floating into Yiwu City from other areas in China. The spatial layout of Yiwu's pull forces is proved as a V-shaped pattern consisting of the two axes by using explorative spatial data analysis and map visualization method. The migration models with (model 3) or without (model 2) migration stock are presented and estimated using standard linear regression model, spatial error model as well as spatial lag model at the county scale in Jiangxi province. Based on the likelihood statistics, the AIC and the Moran's I statistics of residuals, the model with migration stock provides an improved fit over the model without migration stock. The correlation between migration ratio and man land ratio is significant at the 0.5 level according to estimates of model 3 and spatial version of model 2. All the three estimates of model 2 and the OLS results of model 3 confirm the distance-decay effect while results from the spatial version of model 3 failed to support the distance rule in population floating. Contrary to the previous studies at the provincial level, the correlation between per capital net income of rural labor forces and migration ratio is not significant according to the three versions of the two models due to the small disparities of income within the counties in Jiangxi. Examination of specification tests in spatial version of model 3 indicates that there is less significant spatial error dependence in the spatial lag models than spatial lag dependence in the error models, further suggesting a preference for the lag model. Model 2 does not suggest any preference for choosing spatial error model and spatial lag model. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Floating population; GIS; Origin distribution visualization; Spatial regression model; Yiwu City","Data visualization; Errors; Geographic information systems; Linear regression; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Regression analysis; Visualization; Floating populations; Linear regression models; Origin distribution visualizations; Spatial data analysis; Spatial error models; Spatial lag models; Spatial regression model; Yiwu cities; Population statistics","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41001314); National Science and Technology Program during the Twelfth Five-year Plan Period, (2009BAH50B01-05)","The research is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of 41001314) and the national science & technology pillar program (No. 2009BAH50B01-05).","Ravenstein E.G., The laws of migration, Journal of Statistical Society of London, 48, 2, pp. 167-235, (1885); Bagne D.J., Principles of Demography, (1969); Lee E., A theory of migration, Demography, 3, pp. 47-57, (1966); Haynes K.E., Fotheringham A.S., Gravity and Spatial Interaction Models, (1984); Fotheringham A.S., O'Kelly M.E., Spatial Interaction Models: Formulations and Applications, (1989); Manski C., The structure of random utility models, Theory and Decision, 8, pp. 229-254, (1977); Liaw K.L., Joint effects of personal factors and ecological variables on the interprovincial migration pattern of young adults in Canada, Geographical Analysis, 22, pp. 189-208, (1990); Liaw K.L., Ledent L., Nested logit models and maximum quasi-likelihood method, Regional Science and Urban Economics, 17, pp. 67-88, (1987); Champion A., Fotheringham S., Rees P., Boyle P., Stillwell J., The determinants of migration flows in england: A review of existing data and evidence, Report Prepared for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, (1998); Todaro M.P., A model of labour migration and urban unemployment in less developed countries, American Economic Review, 59, 1, pp. 486-489, (1969); Richard A., James C.K., Population Growth, Employment and Economic-Demographic Interactions in Kenya: Bachue-Kenya, (1983); Anselin L., Spatial Econometrics: Methods and Models, (1988); Chi G., Zhu J., Spatial regression models for demographic analysis, Population Research Policy Review, 27, pp. 17-42, (2008); Li Q., An analysis of push and pull factors in the migration of rural workers in China, Social Sciences in China, 1, pp. 125-136, (2003); He J., Multivariate Spatial Interaction Models As Applied to China's Inter-provincial Migration 1982-1990, (1999); Getis A., Spatial autocorrelation, Handbook of Applied Spatial Analysis, pp. 255-278, (2010)","H.

Because of their high temporal granularity, many migration estimates can be generated from the same data set by changing the definition parameters. Yet despite the growing application of digital trace data to migration research, strategies for taking advantage of their temporal granularity remain largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we provide a general framework for converting digital trace data into estimates of migration transitions and for systematically analyzing their variation along a quasicontinuous time scale, analogous to a survival function. From migration theory, we develop two simple hypotheses regarding how we expect our estimated migration transition functions to behave. We then test our hypotheses on simulated data and empirical data from three platforms in two internal migration contexts: geotagged Tweets and Gowalla check-ins in the United States, and cell-phone call detail records in Senegal. Our results demonstrate the need for evaluating the internal consistency of migration estimates derived from digital trace data before using them in substantive research. At the same time, however, common patterns across our three empirical data sets point to an emergent research agenda using digital trace data to study the specific functional relationship between estimates of migration and time and how this relationship varies by geography and population characteristics. © 2021 The Authors.","Big data; Methods; Migration; Mobility","Geography; Humans; Population Dynamics; Senegal; United States; geography; human; population dynamics; Senegal; United States","","","","","Jubiläumsfonds der Stadt Wien für die Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften, (STE0059); Max Planck Institute of Demographic Research; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (P2CHD042828, T32HD007543); World Bank Group, WBG; University of Washington, UW; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology, University of Washington, CSDE; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41871142); Agence Française de Développement, AFD","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments Support for this research came from a Shanahan Endowment Fellowship, a Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development training grant (T32 HD007543), and a Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development research infrastructure grant (R2 HD042828) to the Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology (CSDE) at the University of Washington.

Our results show that due to the high level of urbanization in this region, natural conditions are no longer the strongest determinants of population distribution. New transportation modes, such as high-speed rail, have arisen as a significant determinant of population distribution and short-term migration, particularly in large cities. Socio-economic factors such as GDP, investment, urbanization level, and technology, which are traditionally assumed to govern population distribution and short-term migration, have less influence although education still remains an important factor affecting population distribution. These findings will contribute valuable information to regional planning decision-making in the Jing-Jin-Ji region.","","China; Datasets as Topic; Electronic Data Processing; Humans; Population Dynamics; Transportation; Urban Population; Urbanization; China; human; information processing; population dynamics; traffic and transport; urban population; urbanization","","","","","","","Gleick P.H., Population, Environment, and Development, (1997); Carr D.L., Suter L., Barbieri A., Population dynamics and tropical deforestation: State of the debate and conceptual challenges, Popul.

However, quantitative analysis of IT data has been hindered by the piecemeal development of relevant statistical models. The most promising approach relies on stochastic Markovian models of bacterial population dynamics within and among organs. Here we present an efficient numerical method to fit such stochastic dynamic models to in vivo experimental IT data. A common approach to statistical inference with stochastic dynamic models relies on producing large numbers of simulations, but this remains a slow and inefficient method for all but simple problems, especially when tracking bacteria in multiple locations simultaneously. Instead, we derive and solve the systems of ordinary differential equations for the two lower-order moments of the stochastic variables (mean, variance and covariance). For any given model structure, and assuming linear dynamic rates, we demonstrate how the model parameters can be efficiently and accurately estimated by divergence minimisation. We then apply our method to an experimental dataset and compare the estimates and goodness-of-fit to those obtained by maximum likelihood estimation. While both sets of parameter estimates had overlapping confidence regions, the new method produced lower values for the division and death rates of bacteria: these improved the goodness-of-fit at the second time point at the expense of that of the first time point. This flexible framework can easily be applied to a range of experimental systems. Its computational efficiency paves the way for model comparison and optimal experimental design. © 2017 Price et al.","","Animals; Bacterial Infections; Computational Biology; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Models, Biological; Stochastic Processes; Computational efficiency; Dynamic models; Dynamics; Markov processes; Maximum likelihood estimation; Numerical methods; Ordinary differential equations; Parameter estimation; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Animal model; Bacterial infections; Goodness of fit; Infection dynamics; Inference methods; Isogenic; Laboratory animals; Statistic modeling; Stochastic dynamics models; Time points; algorithm; analytic method; Article; bacterial death; bacterial division; bacterial infection; bacterial load; bacterial migration; bacterial phenomena and functions; controlled study; data analysis; dynamics; intermethod comparison; mathematical computing; mathematical model; maximum likelihood estimation; measurement accuracy; methodology; moments based inference method; nonhuman; quality control; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; simulation; stochastic model; velocity; animal; bacterial infection; biological model; biology; host pathogen interaction; Markov chain; microbiology; Bacteria","","","","","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, BBSRC, (BB/I002189/1, BB/M020193/1)","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council grant BB/M020193/1 awarded to OR, and to support DJP.

This article is an innovative attempt to analyse econometrically the key factors affecting the youth unemployment rate and the ratio between youth and total unemployment rates for 75 Russian regions in 2000-09. The existing literature on regional labour market performance and dynamics suggested the use of a large set of explanatory variables (with indicators of the level of economic development, the demographic situation and migration processes, and the export-import levels) in a GMM panel data analysis, taking into account both spatial correlation and endogeneity problems. Although we were searching for structural determinants, we also investigated the effect of the 2008-09 financial crisis. The econometric results, presented and discussed using several models, have key policy implications for both national and regional levels of government. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","Russian Federation; econometrics; economic development; financial crisis; government; labor market; unemployment","","","","","","","Abowd J., Kramarz F., Lemieux T., Margolis D., Minimum wages and youth employment in France and the United States, NBER working paper, 6111, (1997); Arpaia A., Curci N., EU labour market behaviour during the great recession, European economy, economic papers, 405, (2010); Barbieri G., Sestito P., Temporary workers in Italy: who they are and where they end up, Labour, 22, 1, pp. 127-166, (2008); Basile R., de Benedictis L., Regional unemployment and productivity in Europe, Papers in regional science, 87, 2, (2008); Bassanini A., Duval R., Employment patterns in OECD countries: reassessing the role of policies and institutions, OECD Economics Department working paper, 486, (2006); Belke A., Endogenous optimum currency areas and the blend of sectors - on the determinants of business cycle correlation across European regions, Journal of economic integration, 22, 1, pp. 26-49, (2007); Belke A., Heine J.M., Specialisation patterns and the synchronicity of regional employment cycles in Europe, IEEP (Springer-Verlag), 3, pp. 91-104, (2006); Bell D.N.F., Blanchflower D.G., What should be done about rising unemployment in the UK, IZA discussion paper, 4040, (2009); Blanchard O.J., Katz L.F., Regional evolutions, Brookings papers on economic activity, 1, pp. 1-75, (1992); Booth A.L., Francesconi M., Frank J., Temporary jobs: stepping stones or dead ends?, Economic journal, 112, 480, (2002); Bornhorst F., Commander S., Regional unemployment and its persistence in transition countries, Economics of transition, 14, 2, pp. 269-288, (2006); Brunello G., Checchi D., School quality and family background in Italy, Economics of education review, 24, 5, pp. 563-577, (2005); Brunello G., Garibaldi P., Wasmer E., Education and training in Europe, (2007); Carmeci L., Mauro L., Long run growth and investment in education: does unemployment matter?, Journal of macroeconomics, 25, pp. 123-137, (2003); Caroleo F.E., Pastore F., Youth participation in the labour market in Germany, Spain and Sweden, Youth unemployment and social exclusion in Europe, (2003); Caroleo F.E., Pastore F., The youth experience gap: Explaining differences across EU countries, (2007); Checchi D., The Italian educational system: Family background and social stratification, (2003); Checchi D., The economics of education, (2006); Choudhry M., Marelli E., Signorelli M., Youth unemployment and the impact of financial crises, International journal of manpower, 1, (2012); Clark K.B., Summers L.H., The dynamics of youth unemployment, The youth labour market problem: Its nature, causes and consequences, (1982); Cockx B., Picchio M., Are short-lived jobs stepping stones to long-lasting jobs?, IZA discussion paper, 4004, (2009); Demidova O., Signorelli M., The impact of crises on youth unemployment of Russian regions: an empirical analysis, China-USA business review, 10, 7, pp. 491-507, (2011); Elhorst J.P., The mystery of regional unemployment differentials: theoretical and empirical explanations, Journal of economic surveys, 17, 5, pp. 709-748, (2003); European Commission, Employment in Europe 2008, Chapter 5, (2008); Fatas A., Countries or regions?

These types of analyses provide robust parameter estimates which fully reflect all available information, as well as estimates of parameters that would be unidentifiable in a separate analysis. In this article we present an integrated Bayesian analysis of four long-term datasets (counts, two mark-recapture-recovery time series, and productivity) relating to a colony of common guillemots (Uria aalge) on the Isle of May, southeast Scotland. A complication when considering the dynamics of populations of this kind is the unobservable emigration of immature animals. In the analysis of mark-recapture-recovery data, the rate of emigration is frequently confounded with that of mark loss and it is only possible to estimate the product of these parameters. By combining all available data for the Isle of May guillemots in an integrated population model, we are able to estimate these parameters separately and thus obtain improved estimates of prerecruitment emigration. © International Biometric Society 2009.","Bayesian inference; Combined data; Common guillemot (Uria aalge); Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC); Population dynamics; State-space model","Fife; Isle of May; Scotland; United Kingdom; Alcidae; Animalia; Uria aalge; Bayesian analysis; biometry; emigration; mark-recapture method; Markov chain; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; recruitment (population dynamics); seabird; spatial data; wild population","","","","","Natural Environment Research Council, NERC, (smru10001)","","Besbeas P., Freeman S.N., Methods for Joint Inference From Panel Survey and Demographic Data, Ecology, 87, 5, pp. 1138-1145, (2006); Besbeas P., Borysiewicz R.S., Morgan B.J.T., Completing the Ecological Jigsaw, Modeling Demographic Processes in Marked Populations.

The impact of COVID-19 has been significant, raising concerns regarding public health risks in China and worldwide. Migration may be the primary reason for the long-distance transmission of the disease. In this study, the following analyses were performed. (1) Using the data from the China migrant population survey in 2017 (Sample size = 432,907), a matrix of the residence–birthplace (R-B matrix) of migrant populations is constructed. The matrix was used to analyze the confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Prefecture-level Cities from February 1–15, 2020 after the outbreak in Wuhan, by calculating the probability of influx or outflow migration. We obtain a satisfactory regression analysis result (R2 = 0.826–0.887, N = 330). (2) We use this R-B matrix to simulate an outbreak scenario in 22 immigrant cities in China, and propose risk prevention measures after the outbreak. If similar scenarios occur in the cities of Wenzhou, Guangzhou, Dongguan, or Shenzhen, the disease transmission will be wider. (3) We also use a matrix to determine that cities in Henan province, Anhui province, and Municipalities (such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing) in China will have a high risk level of disease carriers after a similar emerging epidemic outbreak scenario due to a high influx or outflow of migrant populations. © 2020 by the authors.

This study aimed to clarify the effects of relative deprivation on QOL and mediating effects of social exclusion among Chinese internal migrants. Study design: This is a secondary data analysis of a nationally representative survey. Methods: We obtained data from 14,816 internal immigrants, aged 15–59 years, throughout China using the 2014 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS). We measured relative deprivation via a modified Yitzhaki Index, social exclusion using a four-point Likert scale, and QOL using the Kessler Psychological Distress Short Scale, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, and a subscale of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey. Survey data of 15,996 local residents were also retrieved and analyzed to make possible comparisons between the local and migrant population. Furthermore, we used descriptive and statistical analyses with data from the CMDS to identify relative deprivation and social exclusion. Results: The results show relative deprivation both directly and indirectly influences Chinese internal migrants' QOL. Specifically, compared with the local population, relative deprivation triggers serious social exclusion (β = 0.008, P < 0.001), ultimately deteriorating QOL. Social exclusion partially mediated the total effects of relative deprivation on mental illness (β = 0.004, P < 0.001), self-rated health (β = −0.285, P < 0.001), and life satisfaction (β = −0.020, P < 0.001) among Chinese internal migrants. Conclusion: Relative deprivation significantly impacts QOL by exacerbating mental illness, eroding self-rated health, and inhibiting life satisfaction. Relative deprivation is significantly directly associated with various indicators of QOL and indirectly affects QOL through social exclusion. In addition, our results demonstrate that the relative deprivation theoretical approach and the modified Yitzhaki Index are worthy of future investigation in studies of migrants' health. © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health","China; Immigrants; Modified Yitzhaki Index; Quality of life; Relative deprivation; Social exclusion","Adolescent; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; China; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Population Dynamics; Quality of Life; Social Distance; Social Isolation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Transients and Migrants; Young Adult; China; health status; health survey; immigrant population; internal migration; mental health; quality of life; social exclusion; socioeconomic conditions; adolescent; adult; Article; China; Chinese; female; health survey; human; Kessler Psychological Distress Short Scale; life satisfaction; Likert scale; male; mental disease; migrant; quality of life; relative; relative deprivation; Satisfaction with Life Scale; scoring system; social exclusion; social problem; Yitzhaki Index; Asian continental ancestry group; mental disease; middle aged; migration; population dynamics; psychology; questionnaire; social distance; social isolation; young adult","","","","","Key Project of The Key Research Center for Humanities and Social Sciences of Chinese Ministry of Education, (16JJD860003)","This study was supported by Key Project of The Key Research Center for Humanities and Social Sciences of Chinese Ministry of Education (grant no. 16JJD860003 ).

Here, we first generalize Wen et al., (2011; 2013) approach to a system composed of multiple study populations (multi-state) with two age groups, where an imputation approach is employed to account for the uncertainty inherent in the population assignment information. Then we develop a different, individual-level mixture model approach to integrate the individual-level population assignment information with the capture-recapture data. Our simulation and real data analyses show that the fusion of population assignment information with capture-recapture data allows us to estimate the origination-specific recruitment of new animals to the system and the dispersal process between populations within the system. Compared to a standard capture-recapture model, our new models improve the estimation of demographic parameters, including survival probability, origination-specific entry probability, and especially the probability of movement between populations, yielding higher accuracy and precision. © 2014, The International Biometric Society.","Capture-recapture; Dispersal; Genetic assignment tests; Imputation approach; Kangaroo rat; Mixture model; Multi-state; Population assignment procedure; Robust-design; Semiparametric; Superpopulation","Algorithms; Animal Migration; Animals; Biometry; Computer Simulation; Dipodomys; Ecology; Ecosystem; Female; Likelihood Functions; Male; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Population Dynamics; Animalia; Dipodomys; Assignment test; Capture-recapture; Dispersal; Genetic assignment test; Imputation approach; Kangaroo rat; Mixture modeling; Multi-state; Population assignment procedure; Robust designs; Semiparametric; Superpopulation; age class; animal; biometry; demography; dispersal; mark-recapture method; numerical model; population modeling; precision; recruitment (population dynamics); survival; algorithm; animal; biological model; biometry; computer simulation; Dipodomys; ecology; ecosystem; female; genetics; male; physiology; population dynamics; population migration; procedures; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Population statistics","","","","","","","Arnason A.N., Researches in Population Ecology, 13, pp. 97-113, (1972); Arnason A.N., Researches in Population Ecology, 15, pp. 1-8, (1973); Ashford J., Jones C., Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 71, pp. 87-94, (2007); Blei D.M., Jordan M.I., Ng A.Y., Et al., Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Brownie C., Hines J.E., Nichols J.D., Pollock K.H., Hestbeck J.B., Biometrics, 49, pp. 1173-1187, (1993); Crosbie S.F., Manly B.F.J., Biometrics, 41, pp. 385-398, (1985); Erosheva E.A., Fienberg S.E., Joutard C., The Annals of Applied Statistics, 1, pp. 502-537, (2007); Hestbeck J.B., Nichols J.D., Malecki R.A., Ecology, 72, pp. 523-533, (1991); Jolly G.M., Biometrika, 52, pp. 225-247, (1965); Joshi N., Brady M., International Journal of Computer Vision, 88, pp. 52-68, (2010); Kendall W.L., Pollock K.H., (1992); Kendall W.L., Hines J.E., Nichols J.D., Ecology, 84, pp. 1058-1066, (2003); Lebreton J.D., Nichols J.D., Barker R.J., Pradel R., Spendelow J.A., Advances in Ecological Research, 42, pp. 88-173, (2009); McLaren C.E., Kambour E., McLachlan G.J., Lukaski H.C., Li X., Brittenham G.M., Mclaren G.D., Statistics in Medicine, 19, pp. 83-98, (2000); McLaren C.E., Cadez I.V., Smyth P., McLachlan G.J., 2000 Proceedings of the Biomerics Section, (2000); Piry S., Alapetite A., Cornuet J.-M., Paetkau D., Baudouin L., Estoup A., Journal of Heredity, 95, pp. 536-539, (2004); Pollock K.H., Journal of Wildlife Management, 46, pp. 757-760, (1982); Pollock K.H., Nichols J.D., Brownie C., Hines J.E., Wildlife Monographs, 107, (1990); Pradel R., Biometrics, 61, pp. 442-447, (2005); Pulliam H.R., The American Naturalist, 132, pp. 652-661, (1988); Rubin D.B., Multiple Imputation for Nonresponse in Surveys, (1987); Runge J.P., Runge M.P., Nichols J.D., The American Naturalist, 167, pp. 925-938, (2006); Sanderlin J.S., Waser P.M., Hines J., Nichols J.D., Proceedings of the Royal Society, London, 279, pp. 480-488, (2012); Schwarz C.J., Arnason A.N., Biometrics, 52, pp. 860-873, (1996); Schwarz C.J., Stobo W.T., Biometrics, 53, pp. 178-194, (1997); Schwarz C.J., Schweigert J.F., Arnason A.N., Biometrics, 49, pp. 177-193, (1993); Seber G.A.F., Biometrika, 52, pp. 249-259, (1965); Seber G.A.F., (1982); Waser P.M., De Woody J.A., Behavioral Ecology, 17, pp. 971-978, (2006); Waser P.M., Hadfield J.D., Molecular Ecology, 20, pp. 1277-1288, (2011); Wen Z., Pollock K.H., Nichols J.D., Waser P.M., Biometrics, 67, pp. 691-700, (2011); Wen Z., Pollock K.H., Nichols J.D., Waser P.M., Environmental and Ecological Statistics, 29, pp. 1-19, (2013)","Z.

Meanwhile, few of them integrate explorative spatial data analysis and spatial regression model into migration analysis. Based on aggregated registered floating population data from 2005 to 2008, the phenomena that population floating to Yiwu City in Zhejiang Province is analyzed at the provincial and county levels. The spatial layout of Yiwu's pull forces is proved as a V-shaped pattern excluding Sichuan Province based on map visualization method. Using the migration ratio in 2007 as an explanatory variable, two models are compared using ordinary least square, spatial error model and spatial lag model methods for county-level data in Jiangxi and Anhui provinces. The model with migration stock provides an improved fitting over the model without migration stock according to the model fitting results. The floating population flocking into Yiwu City from Jiangxi is determined mostly by migration stock while the determinant factors are migration stock and distance to Yiwu City for Anhui. The distance- decay effect is true for migration flow from Anhui to Yiwu City while the distance rule is not confirmed in Jiangxi with the best fitting model. The correlation between per capita net income of rural labor forces and migration ratio is not significant in Jiangxi and significant but at the 0.1 level only in Anhui. Further analysis shows that the distance, income and man-land ratio are important factors to explain population floating at earlier stage. However, as the dynamic population floating process evolves, the determinant factor would be migration stock. © Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.","Floating population; Gis; Origin distribution visualization; Spatial regression model; Yiwu city","China; Xinjiang Uygur; Yiwu; Zhejiang; error analysis; geographical distribution; migration; numerical model; population dynamics; regression analysis; spatial analysis","","","","","Youth Science Funds of State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (KA11040101); National Key Technology R & D Program of China, (2012BAI32B07); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41001314)","Received date: 2011-10-27; accepted date: 2011-12-27 Foundation item: Under the auspices of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41001314), Youth Science Funds of State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. KA11040101), National Key Technology R & D Program of China (No. 2012BAI32B07) Corresponding author: WANG Yingjie.

Population dynamics and regional social security sustainability in Italy, Regional Studies. Making due allowances for differences in demographics, the labour market and internal migration dynamics, this study analyses the sustainability of the Italian pension balance at a regional level. A worsening of the elderly dependency ratio and a decline in birth and employment rates have generated a negative trend, particularly for regions in southern Italy, characterized by early retirement and an increase in migration outflows. The suggestion is that a decentralized pension policy is not a Pareto-efficient solution because it would favour the sustainability of the pension balance in northern regions over those in the South. © 2014 Regional Studies Association.","Demographic ageing; Interregional migration; Panel data analysis; Public pensions; Regional differences","Italy; internal migration; panel data; pension system; population dynamics; regional economy; social security; sustainability","","","","","","","Rapporto Svimez 2011 sull'Economia del Mezzogiorno, (2011); Besley T., Case A., Incumbent behavior: vote seeking, tax setting and yardstick competition, American Economic Review, 85, pp. 25-45, (1995); Bianchi L., Squarcio C., Tuzi D., (2001); Bloom D.E., Canning D., Fink G., (2011); Bonasia M., De Siano R., Migrazione interregionale in Italia: quale contributo alla sostenibilità dei bilanci previdenziali territoriali?, Flussi migratori e capitale umano, pp. 187-212, (2012); Borjas G.J., The economic analysis of immigration, Handboook of Labor Economics, 3A, (1997); Brugiavini A., (1999); Brugiavini A., Early retirement in Europe, European Review, 9, pp. 501-515, (2001); Butler M., Anticipation effects of looming public-pension reforms, Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, 50, pp. 119-159, (1999); Capasso S., Carillo M.R., De Siano R., Migration flows, structural change and growth convergence: a panel data analysis of the Italian Regions, Manchester School, 80, pp. 468-498, (2012); Diamond P., Valdes-Prieto S., Insulation of pensions from political risk, The Economics of Pensions, Principles Policies and International Experience, pp. 33-57, (1997); Diamond P., The economics of social security reform: an overview, Framing the Social Security Debate: Values, Politics and Economics, (1998); Diamond P., Lindeman D., Young H., Social Security.

Then, the characteristics and spatial patterns of daily population flows are studied by social network analysis. Subsequently, the exponential random graph model is used to investigate the influence of dynamic characteristics of changes in the spatial structure of the interprovincial population flow network during the postepidemic period. The spatial structure of the population flow network before, during, and after the epidemic shows significantly different characteristics, with epidemic prevention and control measures playing a significant role in restricting population flows. Interprovincial population flows have a certain degree of transmissibility, but two-way flows are not obvious. In addition, for regions with a larger resident population and a higher unemployment rate, a larger population tends to flow out. For regions with higher per capita GDP, the secondary and tertiary industries account for a relatively larger proportion, and the public environment is better. The more attractive a region is to the population, the higher is the tendency towards population inflows.

Firstly, the relations between cities have obvious club characteristics. )e rich nodes tend to connect with the rich nodes, while the nonrich nodes tend to connect with the nonrich nodes. Secondly, the connection between cities has the effect of hierarchical proximity, and cities mainly establish spatial connections with cities of the same level and adjacent level. )irdly, the relations between cities also have the effect of geographical proximity, and the degree of influence of geographical proximity in low-level cities is greater than that in high-level cities. Fourthly, the external connection mode of high-level cities is to establish close contact with high-level cities adjacent to the level, with strong attraction to low-level cities adjacent to the location at the same time. )elow-level cities are closely related to the high-level cities adjacent to the location and other cities of geographical proximity or adjacent level. )is study helps to further understand the complex characteristics and laws of intercity connections and urban networks.

Catering is the basis of human activities, therefore, quantitative analysis of restaurant consumption in mega cities has positive significance for mastering the factors affecting consumption and optimizing urban commercial layout. We select the dining venue within 1 km along the 2nd Ring Road of Beijing as the research target. First, based on the Dianping and Baidu Map, the sample crawling and calculation are performed, and then we establish a system of factors affecting the popularity of the restaurant, including comprehensive star level, per capita, the shortest distance from the nearest subway station, and the number of municipal-level commercial service centers within 1 km. Through the significance test and Box-Cox transformation, a multiple linear regression model affecting the popularity of restaurant is established, and the model is optimized by stepwise regression method. According to the effective samples of 200 restaurants, the results show that in the central area of mega city, the comprehensive experience of the restaurant and group effect have the greatest impact on the popularity of restaurant. Based on the results, it is suggested that the overall planning of the urban commercial district should fully consider the composition of the catering consumption capacity and the improvement of operational management capabilities. © 2019 IEEE.","catering consumption; linear regression; mega city; online reviews; popularity of restaurants","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Economics; Linear regression; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Population dynamics; Subway stations; Zoning; Box Cox transformation; catering consumption; Megacities; Multiple linear regression models; Online reviews; Operational management; popularity of restaurants; Stepwise regression method; Population statistics","","","","","Key Scientific Research projects of Henan Province Education Department, (17A520026, 18A520004); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61802115); Science and Technology Program of Hunan Province, (182102210249, 182102310925, 19A520008)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported in part by Key Scientific Research projects of Henan Province Education Department (No.18A520004, 17A520026), Henan province science and technology projects (No. 182102310925, 182102210249, 19A520008), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61802115).","Romanov V.A., Russian large cities' open data: Problems of innovative development, Proc. of International Conference on Electronic Governance and Open Society: Challenges in Eurasia (EGOSE '16), pp. 120-125, (2016); Ip I., Fong S., Yan Z., Et al., Competitive intelligence study on macau food and beverage industry, International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data.

Using 2000 and 2010 census data, this study explores the degree, pace, and pattern of population ageing and its driving mechanism using exploratory spatial data analysis and the geographically weighed regression model. Between 2000 and 2010, population ageing increased rapidly countrywide; yet, spatial differences between eastern and western China narrowed. The degree of provincial population ageing and its spatiality were determined by natural population growth, migration, and local economic development. Life expectancy and mortality were the primary long-term factors, and GDP per capita was the prime contributor in the early days of economic development; the migration rate was the dominant influence after 2010. China’s overall spatial differentiation of population ageing shifted from a north–south to an east–west division. © 2021 Wu et al.

Factors influencing the development of demography in the city and models that need to be built for further research have been identified. All models will be built in the program ""PowerSim"". The first model of the housing sector was built, which displays all the necessary variables. The constants and variables, which should be introduced to construct a model of population size, have been determined. Considering the built model, it is concluded that with the increase in the number of jobs, the birth rate increases (due to a number of positive factors). A level model of the number of jobs was built to show the links between increasing jobs, increasing the general well-being of the population and increasing the birth rate. The following graphs and tables have been added for illustration of the built-up model: Parameters of population - parameter of ""land and housing"", drawing ""Population""and ""Share of builtup land"", deflecting corresponding growth of indicators.

In addition to epidemic data, environmental and social factors including population migration, temperature and internet search data were considered. We compared the performance of long short-term memory (LSTM) model and convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The performance of the CNN model was 12.5% higher than that of the LSTM model. Moreover, population migration and internet search data can respectively improve the prediction performance of the model.

In China, the policy of ecological migration is a new approach to protect the urban ecological environment. However, the changes in livelihood capital before and after migration and the matching relationship between the livelihood capital and livelihood model of migrants are rarely explored. Our study aims to address these research gaps to determine factors affecting the urban integration of eco-migrant families and their means of sustainable livelihood. Methods. We used the survey data of migrant households in China in 2017 and 2018. Heckman’s two-stage model and the endogenous transformation regression model were applied for data analysis. Results. First, most migrants are willing to integrate into urban life after relocation, but the efficiency of their integration into urban life needs to be improved. Second, differences in demographic background and geographic location significantly affect the decisions of migrants in urban integration. Third, family heterogeneity has the greatest impact on the degree of urban integration, followed by geographical location. Lastly, the high degree of urban integration of migrants has a significant impact on their household income. Conclusions. Local governments and communities should provide immigrant families migrating from rural to urban China with more social and economic resources for their better socioeconomic integration. © 2022 by the authors.","endogenous transformation and regression; Heckman’s two-stage model; policy implications; rural to urban immigration; urban integration; west China","China; environmental factor; geographical region; immigrant; migration; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis","","","","","","","Fathollahi-Fard A.M., Ahmadi A., Al-e Hashem S.M., Sustainable closed-loop supply chain network for an integrated water supply and wastewater collection system under uncertainty, J.

However, knowledge of population exposure to urban greenspace across different spatiotemporal scales remains unclear. Moreover, the majority of existing environmental assessments are unable to quantify how residents enjoy their ambient greenspace during their daily life. To deal with this challenge, we proposed a dynamic method to assess urban greenspace exposure with the integration of mobile-phone locating-request (MPL) data and high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images. This method was further applied to 30 major cities in China by assessing cities’ dynamic greenspace exposure levels based on residents’ surrounding areas with different buffer scales (0.5 km, 1 km, and 1.5 km). Results showed that regarding residents’ 0.5-km surrounding environment, Wenzhou and Hangzhou were found to be with the greenest exposure experience, whereas Zhengzhou and Tangshan were the least ones. The obvious diurnal and daily variations of population exposure to their surrounding greenspace were also identified to be highly correlated with the distribution pattern of urban greenspace and the dynamics of human mobility. Compared with two common measurements of urban greenspace (green coverage rate and green area per capita), the developed method integrated the dynamics of population distribution and geographic locations of urban greenspace into the exposure assessment, thereby presenting a more reasonable way to assess population exposure to urban greenspace. Additionally, this dynamic framework could hold potential utilities in supporting urban planning studies and environmental health studies and advancing our understanding of the magnitude of population exposure to greenspace at different spatiotemporal scales. © 2018","Dynamic assessment; Geo-spatial big data; Human mobility; Public health; Urban greenspace","China; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environment; Environment Design; Environmental Exposure; Urban Population; Health; Plasma interactions; Population distribution; Population statistics; Public health; Remote sensing; Urban planning; Distribution patterns; Dynamic assessment; Environmental assessment; Geo-spatial; High spatial resolution; Human mobility; Surrounding environment; Urban greenspace; environmental assessment; greenspace; health impact; mobility; population distribution; spatial data; spatiotemporal analysis; urban design; urban population; Article; China; city planning; environmental health; geographic distribution; image processing; information processing; intermethod comparison; migration; mobile phone locating request data; photoperiodicity; population distribution; population dynamics; population exposure; priority journal; remote sensing; spatial analysis; urban area; urban greenspace; analysis; city; environment; environmental exposure; environmental planning; environmental protection; procedures; statistics and numerical data; urban population; Big data","","","","","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2017M620739)","The authors thank Tencent Inc. for making the mobile-phone locating-request big data publicly available and Google Inc. for making the high-spatial-resolution satellite imagery publicly available.

A theoretical analysis of the relationship among per capita rural income, the urban-rural income gap, and fertilizer use intensity is developed, which is similar to the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis. Both the Theil index and urban-rural income ratio are employed to measure the urban-rural income gap using a provincial-level panel dataset covering 25 provincial-level administrative regions over the period 1995-2017. The estimation results of the system Generalized Method of Moments show that the expansion of the urban-rural income gap significantly increases fertilizer use intensity. While an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between fertilizer use intensity and per capita rural income, the peak turning point is much higher than the actual per capita rural income of all provinces in China. This demonstrates that fertilizer use intensity would further increase with the growth of rural income over a period of time. In addition, a lower growth rate of the agricultural product price, larger total sown size, and technological progress are likely to reduce fertilizer use intensity. This study has several important policy implications for promoting the sustainable development of agriculture and rural areas in China. Specifically, efforts must be made to narrow the urban-rural income gap, encourage agricultural research and extension, and promote land conversion and appropriately scaled-up agricultural business. © 2020 by the authors.","Environmental kuznets curve; Fertilizer use; Theil index; Urban-rural income gap","China; agricultural extension; agricultural policy; agricultural research; agricultural technology; fertilizer application; household income; Kuznets curve; panel data; rural economy; sustainable development; urban-rural migration","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology of China, (2016YFD0201301); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71661147002, 71803010)","Funding: This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71803010, and 71661147002), and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2016YFD0201301).","Gong B., Agricultural reforms and production in China: Changes in provincial production function and productivity in 1978-2015, J.

According to the bibliometric analysis, more than 13,000 papers related to the COVID-19 have been published since the beginning of the pandemic. Related researches include not only the pathogenic mechanism of the virus and the development of specific drugs and vaccines from the medical and biological perspectives, but also the non-pharmaceutical prevention and control methods for the pandemic. The latter is the focus of this paper, in which the research progress on the pandemic is discussed from six aspects: detection of transmission relationships, spatiotemporal pattern analysis, prediction models, spread simulation, risk assessment, and impact evaluation. The research on the detection of transmission relationship mainly includes the detection of cluster cases and transmission relations, among which individual trajectory big data have become the key to research. The progress of the analysis of spatiotemporal patterns of the pandemic shows that the spatiotemporal distribution of the pandemic has significant temporal and spatial heterogeneity, and the spatiotemporal transmission presents typical network characteristics. The prediction of the pandemic mainly relies on dynamic models scaling from macro to micro, in which the non-negligible impact of population migration makes the human flow big data become one of the key elements of model prediction accuracy. In the study of epidemic spread simulation, the focus is on evaluating the effects of controlling measures such as traffic restrictions, community prevention and control, and medical resources allocation through simulation methods. Results show that traffic interruption and community control measures are the most effective means among non-pharmaceutical interventions at present, and the guarantee and reasonable deployment of medical resources are the basis for pandemic prevention and control. After the pandemic is controlled under the effective measures, the resumption of work and production must be in an orderly manner. The research on pandemic risk assessment currently focuses on biological factors, natural factors and social factors. As to biological factors, researches show that the underlying disease and the male (due to their high mobility) are related to a higher risk of infection. Among natural factors, temperature, precipitation and climate have limited influence on the spread of the pandemic. As to social factors, human mobility, population density, and differences in medical conditions caused by social inequity have significant influences on the infection rate. Regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we mainly focus on three aspects: the public psychology, natural environment and economic development. Specifically, the impact of the pandemic is mainly negative on the public psychology and economy, and positive on the natural environment. In conclusion, big data especially individual trajectories and population big data are indeed pervasive in research of non-pharmaceutical intervention. To prevent and control the major outbreaks, the intersection of multiple disciplines and the collaboration of personnel in different fields are indispensable. Although a great progress has been made on various aspects such as the effect of controlling measures and the influencing factors of the pandemic, the spatial traceability, precise prediction and future impact of the pandemic are still unsolved problems. 2021, Science Press.

Such changes impact not only the urban mobility at big cities but also the urban life quality, which is directly affected by pollutant emissions and noise. In order to limit emission impacts on sensitive population (children, elderly people, for example), city managers can enforce bounds on emissions and noise pollution generated by the city traffic in specific regions defined by geographical boundaries. This paper aims to contribute to the challenge of managing urban noise by exploring and analyzing the data with a geofencing approach. In particular, we present a exploratory data analysis toward a case study in Curitiba (1,800,000 inhabitants, a southern Brazilian city) aiming at analyzing possible sources of noise based on a particular data set of noise measurements, geographical information data, traffic, transportation and city licensing data. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

TIPD utilizes record linkage, geocoding, and high-performance in-memory computing technology to construct various dimensions of Taiwan Indigenous Peoples (TIPs) demographics and developments. Embedded in collecting, cleaning, cleansing, processing, exploring, and enriching individual digital records are archival computational science and data science. TIPD consists of three categories of archival open data: (1) categorical data, (2) household structure and characteristics data, and (3) population dynamics data, including cross-sectional time-series categorical data, longitudinally linked population dynamics data, life tables, household statistics, micro genealogy data, marriage practice and ethnic identity data, internal migration data, geocoded data, etc. TIPD big archival data not only help unveil contemporary TIPs demographics and various developments, but also help overcome research barriers and unleash creativity for TIPs studies. © 2017 IEEE.","genealogy; identity; in-memory computing; open data; record linkage; TIPD","Big data; Clustering algorithms; History; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Time series; Computational science; Computing technology; genealogy; Household structures; identity; Indigenous people; Record linkage; TIPD; Open Data","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, MOST, (106-2420-H-001-008-MY2)","The research is mainly supported by a grant from the 2013-2017 bilateral joint research program of Academia Sinica and the Council of Indigenous Affairs on Research on Contemporary Taiwan Indigenous Peoples, and partly by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 106-2420-H-001-008-MY2).

In this paper, we focus on the movements of pastoralists in the Far North Region of Cameroon, who follow an annual transhumance by moving between rainy and dry season pastures. Describing, summarizing, and modeling the transhumance movements in the region are important steps for understanding the role these movements may play in the transmission of infectious diseases affecting humans and animals. We collected data on this transhumance system for four years using a combination of surveys and GPS mapping. An analysis on the spatial and temporal characteristics of pastoral mobility suggests four transhumance modes, each with its own properties. Modes M1 and M2 represent the type of transhumance movements where pastoralists settle in a campsite for a relatively long period of time (≥20 days) and then move around the area without specific directions within a seasonal grazing area. Modes M3 and M4 on the other hand are the situations when pastoralists stay in a campsite for a relatively short period of time (<20 days) when moving between seasonal grazing areas. These four modes are used to develop a spatial-temporal mobility (STM) model that can be used to estimate the probability of a mobile pastoralist residing at a location at any time. We compare the STM model with two reference models and the experiments suggest that the STM model can effectively capture and predict the space-time dynamics of pastoral mobility in our study area.

We find that 6th millennium BCE populations of North/Central Anatolia and the Southern Caucasus shared mixed ancestry on a genetic cline that formed during the Neolithic between Western Anatolia and regions in today's Southern Caucasus/Zagros. During the Late Chalcolithic and/or the Early Bronze Age, more than half of the Northern Levantine gene pool was replaced, while in the rest of Anatolia and the Southern Caucasus, we document genetic continuity with only transient gene flow. Additionally, we reveal a genetically distinct individual within the Late Bronze Age Northern Levant. Overall, our study uncovers multiple scales of population dynamics through time, from extensive admixture during the Neolithic period to long-distance mobility within the globalized societies of the Late Bronze Age.

Historical colonization and determination of its genetic diversity and population structure may provide new information towards the improvement of vector control in the region. In this paper we present thoughtful analyses considering the phylogeography and demographic history of R. nasutus in the Caatinga. Methodology/Principal findings: A total of 157 R. nasutus specimens were collected from Copernicia prunifera palm trees in eight geographic localities within the Brazilian Caatinga biome, sequenced for 595-bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cyt b) and genotyped for eight microsatellite loci. Sixteen haplotypes were detected in the cyt b sequences, two of which were shared between different localities. Molecular diversity indices exhibited low diversity and a haplotype network revealed low divergence among R. nasutus sequences, with two central haplotypes shared by five of the eight populations analyzed. The demographic model that better represented R. nasutus population dynamics was the exponential growth model. Results of the microsatellite data analyses indicated that the entire population is comprised of four highly differentiated groups, with no obvious contemporary geographic barriers that could explain the population substructure detected. A complex pattern of migration was observed, in which a western Caatinga population seems to be the source of emigrants to the eastern populations. Conclusions/Significance: R. nasutus that inhabit C. prunifera palms do not comprise a species complex. The species went through a population expansion at 12–10 ka, during the Holocene, which coincides with end of the largest dry season in South America. It colonized the Caatinga in a process that occurred from west to east in the region. R. nasutus is presently facing an important ecological impact caused by the continuous deforestation of C. prunifera palms in northeast Brazil. We hypothesize that this ecological disturbance might contribute to an increase in the events of invasion and colonization of human habitations. © 2018 Peretolchina et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.","","Animals; Brazil; Cytochromes b; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Insect Vectors; Phylogeography; Rhodnius; Sequence Analysis, DNA; cytochrome b; animal; Brazil; classification; DNA sequence; genetic variation; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; insect vector; phylogeography; Rhodnius","","cytochrome b, 9035-37-4; Cytochromes b, ","","","","","Coura J.R., Chagas disease: what is known and what is needed—a background article, Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz, 102, pp. 113-122, (2007); Chagas Disease (American Trypanosomiasis).

However, ecosystem-based approaches typically use density estimates as surrogates for animal presence and spatial modeling to identify areas for protection and may not take into account daily or seasonal movements of animals. Additionally, sympatric and inter-related species are often managed separately, which may not be cost-effective. This study aims to demonstrate an evidence-based method to inform the biological basis for co-management of two sympatric species, dugongs and green sea turtles. This approach can then be used in conservation planning to delineate areas to maximize species protection. Methodology/Results: Fast-acquisition satellite telemetry was used to track eleven dugongs and ten green turtles at two geographically distinct foraging locations in Queensland, Australia to evaluate the inter- and intra-species spatial relationships and assess the efficacy of existing protection zones. Home-range analysis and bathymetric modeling were used to determine spatial use and compared with existing protection areas using GIS. Dugong and green turtle homeranges significantly overlapped in both locations. However, both species used different core areas and differences existed between regions in depth zone use and home-range size, especially for dugongs. Both species used existing protection areas in Shoalwater Bay, but only a single tracked dugong used the existing protection area in Torres Strait. Conclusions/Significance:: Fast-acquisition satellite telemetry can provide evidence-based information on individual animal movements to delineate relationships between dugongs and green turtles in regions where they co-occur. This information can be used to increase the efficacy of conservation planning and complement more broadly based survey information. These species also use similar habitats, making complimentary co-management possible, but important differences exist between locations making it essential to customize management. This methodology could be applied on a broader scale to include other sympatric and inter-related species. © 2014 Gredzens et al.","","Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Dugong; Geographic Information Systems;

This chapter is aimed to identify the broad adaptation strategies that are more likely to be employed by coastal people against salinity to secure their livelihood. This study heavily draws on quantitative inquiry. Field data and information were collected through a semi-structured questionnaire from 225 respondents selected randomly from salinity-affected three coastal villages located around swampy mangrove forests-Sundarbans in Bangladesh. For data analysis various statistical tools, especially multinomial logistic regression (M-Logit) model, were used. Subsistence agriculture, fisheries, open water fishing, and extraction of both timber and non-timber forest products from Sundarbans have appeared as the dominant sources of livelihood which are seriously impacted by salinity intrusion. Against the impacts of salinity, respondents have adopted almost a dozen of specific strategies and a couple of more they might adopt in the future as well. However, broadly there are three strategies they might eventually employ. M-Logit models have predicted that whether respondents would prefer crop agriculture and allied jobs over saline shrimp farming or intensification of resource extraction from Sundarbans would be significantly determined (LR chi-square = 308.17, pseudo R2 = 0.86, p <.001) by factors such as socio-demographic (education [p =.001], occupation [p =.02], NGO’s membership [p =.00], power in local polity [p =.03]), economic (farm size [p =.002], disaster recovery period [p =.00]), adaptive behavioral (seasonal migration [p =.00], shrimp-harvest failure [p =.05]), and spatial/locational (attachment to the locality [p =.049], tidal inundation of cropland [p =.005], land suitability for cropping [p =.08]) aspects. In line with these findings, suggestions are provided. The policy implication of the study is if measures were taken in line with findings, it would help the poor and marginalized coastal population to better adapt with the impacts of salinity on their natural resource-based livelihood. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.","Adaptation strategies;

Northeastern Brazil, although being an important region in terms of human imigration and ethnic admixture, has little information regarding its population mtDNA composition. Here, we determine which mitochondrial lineages contributed to the formation of the Northeastern Brazilian population. Our sample consisted of 767 individuals distributed as follows i) 550 individuals from eight Northeastern states (Piauí, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, and Bahia) which were sequenced for mtDNA hypervariable segments I, II, and III; ii) 217 individuals from Alagoas and Pernambuco (previously published data). Data analysis was performed through sequence alignment and Haplogrep 2.0 haplogroup assignment tools. Furthermore, maternal ancestry distribution was contextualized and, when possible, related to historical events to better understand the biological interactions and population dynamics that occurred in this region since the beginning of colonization. Results: Unexpectedly, Amerindian mitochondrial ancestry was the highest in the Northeastern region overall, followed by African, European and non-Amerindian Asian, unlike previous results for this region. Alagoas and Pernambuco states, however, showed a larger African mtDNA frequency. The Northeastern region showed an intraregional heterogeneous distribution regarding ancestral groups, in which states/mesoregions located to the north had a prevalent Amerindian ancestral frequency and those to the south had predominance of African ancestry. Moreover, results showed great diversity of European haplogroups and the presence of non-Amerindian Asian haplogroups. Conclusions: Our findings are in disagreement with previous investigations that suggest African mitochondrial ancestry is the most prevalent in the Brazilian Northeast. The predominance of Amerindian lineages exemplifies the importance of indigenous women in the formation of the population, despite intense African slave entry and conflicts with European settlers. The variable distribution of ancestral groups observed in the Northeast is in accordance with historical records showing the similarities with colonization dynamics occurred in the Amazon region and the Brazilian Southeast. Moreover, the variety of European haplogroups suggests multiple origins of founding groups, specially those found in Western European populations. © 2017 The Author(s).","Asymmetric colonization; Genetic diversity; Migration pattern; mtDNA lineages; Northeastern Brazil; Population admixture","African Continental Ancestry Group; American Native Continental Ancestry Group; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Brazil; DNA, Mitochondrial; Ethnic Groups; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Geography; Haplotypes; Humans; Phylogeny; Africa; Brazil; Europe; mitochondrial DNA; ancestry; colonization; genetic variation; migration; mitochondrial DNA; population dynamics; American Indian; Asian continental ancestry group; Black person; Brazil; Caucasian; ethnic group; female; genetic variation; genetics; geography; haplotype; human; phylogeny; population genetics","","DNA, Mitochondrial, ","","","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico; FADESP; PROPESP; Produtividade, (CNPQ 304413/2015-1); Rede de Pesquisa em Genomica Populacional Humana, (3381/2013 CAPES-BioComputacional); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Universidade Federal do Pará, UFPA","This study was supported by Rede de Pesquisa em Genomica Populacional Humana (RPGPH) - 3381/2013 CAPES-BioComputacional, FADESP/PROPESP/UFPA (Universidade Federal do Para) and CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico).

We evaluated partial migration over the entire life cycle of white perch, (Morone americana) within the Hudson River Estuary, combining otolith microchemistry, population demographics and environmental data analysis. Ecological carryover effects were used as a framework to test how environmental variation during the larval period influenced migration behaviors and growth characteristics in subsequent life-stages. Two annual cohorts of juveniles were classified based on whether they persisted in natal habitats (freshwater resident contingent) or dispersed into non-natal habitats (brackish water migratory contingent) as juveniles. The migratory contingent tended to hatch earlier and experience cooler temperatures as larvae, while the availability of zooplankton prey during the larval period appeared to influence growth dynamics before and after metamorphosis. Juvenile migration behaviors were reversible but usually persisted into adulthood. As juveniles, the consequences of partial migration on growth appeared to be modified by river flow, as demonstrated by the influence of a large storm event on feeding conditions in one of the study years. Migratory adults grew faster and attained larger maximum sizes, but may also experience higher rates of mortality. The interplay uncovered between life-stage transitions, conditional migration behaviors and habitat productivity throughout the life cycle shapes white perch population dynamics and will likely play an important role in responses to long-term environmental change. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","","Hudson Estuary; United States; Morone americana; biochemistry; cohort analysis; data interpretation; demography; developmental stage; dispersal; ecological approach; environmental conditions; estuarine environment; feeding ecology; growth; habitat structure; life cycle; metamorphosis; migration; mortality; otolith; perciform; population dynamics; prey availability; river flow; zooplankton","","","","","University of Maryland NanoCenter; Hudson River Foundation, HRF, (009/13A); University of Maryland, UMD","Funding text 1: We thank John Young, the Hudson River Estuary Monitoring Program and Applied Science Associates for allowing us to access white perch standing stocks from Year-Class Reports, as well as David Strayer and the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies for their assistance with acquiring Hudson River monitoring data.

In the most recent genomic studies, this non-African ancestry has been attributed to admixture with Middle Eastern populations during the last few thousand years. However, mitochondrial and Y chromosome data are suggestive of earlier episodes of admixture. To investigate this further, we generated new genome-wide SNP data for a Yemeni population sample and merged these new data with published genome-wide genetic data from the HOA and a broad selection of surrounding populations. We used multidimensional scaling and ADMIXTURE methods in an exploratory data analysis to develop hypotheses on admixture and population structure in HOA populations. These analyses suggested that there might be distinct, differentiated African and non-African ancestries in the HOA. After partitioning the SNP data into African and non-African origin chromosome segments, we found support for a distinct African (Ethiopic) ancestry and a distinct non-African (Ethio-Somali) ancestry in HOA populations. The African Ethiopic ancestry is tightly restricted to HOA populations and likely represents an autochthonous HOA population. The non-African ancestry in the HOA, which is primarily attributed to a novel Ethio-Somali inferred ancestry component, is significantly differentiated from all neighboring non-African ancestries in North Africa, the Levant, and Arabia. The Ethio-Somali ancestry is found in all admixed HOA ethnic groups, shows little inter-individual variance within these ethnic groups, is estimated to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries by at least 23 ka, and does not carry the unique Arabian lactase persistence allele that arose about 4 ka. Taking into account published mitochondrial, Y chromosome, paleoclimate, and archaeological data, we find that the time of the Ethio-Somali back-to-Africa migration is most likely pre-agricultural. © 2014 Hodgson et al.","","Africa, Eastern;

In this study, we revise and standardize the procedures required by the migration matrix model of Malécot ([1950] Ann Univ Lyon Sci [A] 13:37-60), testing it in large historical-demographic databases of 85 populations from three mountain valleys with different degrees of isolation: Val di Lima (Italian Apennines, 21 parishes), Val di Sole, (Italian Alps, 27 parishes), and La Cabrera (Spain, 37 parishes). An add-on package (Biodem) for the R program is proposed to perform all calculations. Results from migration matrices are compared with those obtained from isonymic relationships. Migration and isonymy matrices are derived from 22,781 marriage records. Matrices are analyzed using a nonlinear isolation-by-distance (IBD) model and multivariate techniques (multidimensional scaling, Procrustes rotation, and cluster analysis). Microdifferentiation levels (FST) from the migration data agree with the observed inbreeding values: higher values are found in La Cabrera (FST = 0.0082), the most isolated population; Val di Lima (FST = 0.0015) and Val di Sole (FST = 0.0012) have lower values due to the larger parish population sizes and greater mobility. Temporal changes of FST and IBD are analyzed using the migration matrix approach. The populations show a marked decline in FST values in time, together with increased population mobility and emigration rates. In all three valleys, marital migration and isonymy yield similar results, suggesting that geographic distance is the most important factor structuring the populations. However, isonymy shows a lower correlation with geographic distance than migration matrices do. This difference can be attributed to the differing sensitivity of the methods for past migration events, and to genetic drift. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","","Emigration and Immigration; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genetic Drift; Genetics, Population; Humans; Italy; Male; Names; Spain; Cabrera; article; cluster analysis; data analysis; data base; demography; female; genetic variability; human; inbreeding; Italy; male; marriage; migration; multidimensional scaling; population dynamics; population movement pattern; population size; population structure; priority journal; social isolation; Spain","","","","","","","Blanco Villegas M.J., Boattini A., Rodriguez Otero H., Pettener D., Inbreeding patterns in La Cabrera, Spain: Dispensations, multiple consanguinity analysis, and isonymy, Hum Biol, 76, pp. 191-210, (2004); Bodmer W.F., Cavalli-Sforza L.L., A migration matrix model for the study of random genetic drift, Genetics, 59, pp. 565-592, (1968); Bodmer W.F., Cavalli-Sforza L.L., The analysis of genetic variation using migration distances, Genetic Distance, pp. 45-61, (1974); Branco C.C., Mota-Vieira L., Population structure of Sao Miguel Island, Azores: A surname study, Hum Biol, 75, pp. 929-939, (2003); Calafell F., Hernandez M., Multivariate approach to matrimonial mobility in Catalonia, Hum Biol, 65, pp. 731-742, (1993); Cannings C., Cavalli-Sforza L.L., Human population structure, Advances in Human Genetics, 4, pp. 105-171, (1973); Caravello G.U., Tasso M., Lucchetti E., Distribution of surnames and identities in the Cimbro-Mocheno communities of Italy, Anthropol Anz, 60, pp. 241-253, (2002); Cavalli-Sforza L.L., Some data on the genetic structure of human populations, Proceedings of the 10th International Congress on Genetics, 1, pp. 389-407, (1958); Cavalli-Sforza L.L., Genetic drift for blood groups, The Genetics of Migrant and Isolate Populations, pp. 34-39, (1963); Colantonio S.E., Lasker G.W., Kaplan B.A., Fuster V., Use of surname models in human population biology: A review of recent developments, Hum Biol, 75, pp. 785-807, (2003); Crow J.F., The estimation of inbreeding from isonymy, Hum Biol, 52, pp. 1-14, (1980); Crow J.F., Surnames as biological markers, Hum Biol, 55, pp. 383-397, (1983); Eriksson A.W., Fellman J.O., Workman P.L., Lalouel J.M., Population studies on the Åland islands.

Two sets of data were available from the experiments carried out during two distinct periods: 1990-1991 and 1993-1995. The results of the analysis were compared with the previous analyses and discussed in relation to management of skipjack fisheries in the Maldives and in the Indian Ocean. The movements were found to be highly variable in space and time, and few consistent patterns were observed between the two data sets. Similarly, significantly different estimates of fishing and natural mortality rates were observed from the two data sets. These differences were found, in part, to be due to the uneven distribution of tag releases in both space and time. Estimates of movement and attrition rates show that emigration from the Maldivian fishery to the rest of the Indian Ocean's was small. The exploitation rate was found to be substantial, contributing about 30-40% of the total attrition in the fishery area. Such levels of localized exploitation may be maintained by steady immigration from outside of the Maldives, but more extensive tagging is required to be certain. The impact of tuna fisheries elsewhere in the Indian Ocean on the domestic Maldivian fishery cannot be determined until a comprehensive large-scale tagging program, including all the fisheries in the Indian Ocean, is completed. © 2002 Ifremer/CNRS/Inra/Cemagref/Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

We develop an approach for analyzing case-control data for mobile individuals and apply it to study bladder cancer in 11 counties in southeastern Michigan. At this time data collection is incomplete and no inferences should be drawn - we analyze these data to demonstrate the novel methods. Global, local and focused clustering of residential histories for 219 cases and 437 controls is quantified using time-dependent nearest neighbor relationships. Business address histories for 268 industries that release known or suspected bladder cancer carcinogens are analyzed. A logistic model accounting for smoking, gender, age, race and education specifies the probability of being a case, and is incorporated into the cluster randomization procedures. Sensitivity of clustering to definition of the proximity metric is assessed for 1 to 75 k nearest neighbors. Results: Global clustering is partly explained by the covariates but remains statistically significant at 12 of the 14 levels of k considered. After accounting for the covariates 26 Local clusters are found in Lapeer, Ingham, Oakland and Jackson counties, with the clusters in Ingham and Oakland counties appearing in 1950 and persisting to the present. Statistically significant focused clusters are found about the business address histories of 22 industries located in Oakland (19 clusters), Ingham (2) and Jackson (1) counties. Clusters in central and southeastern Oakland County appear in the 1930's and persist to the present day. Conclusion: These methods provide a systematic approach for evaluating a series of increasingly realistic alternative hypotheses regarding the sources of excess risk. So long as selection of cases and controls is population-based and not geographically biased, these tools can provide insights into geographic risk factors that were not specifically assessed in the case-control study design. © 2006 Jacquez et al;

The controls are under the Russian Federal Migration Service and have the following tasks: ""a) control over the entry onto the country's territory of foreign citizens or stateless persons seeking asylum or in transit, their identification, registration, and recording; b) the implementation of measures to prevent uncontrolled migration and the organization of the deportation of foreigners in cases and within the procedure stipulated by acts of legislation; c) the examination of appeals for asylum from foreign citizens and stateless persons who have come to Russian territory."" Further provisions of the Edict deal with determination of immigration control points and their opening hours, allocation of premises and equipment for the implementation of immigration control activities, financing, information communication systems, procedures for the temporary accommodation and residence of persons seeking asylum, immigration personnel, and the training of such personnel, among other things. In December 1993, the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation issued a Decree to create a statewide automated system of registering the official identity documents of the population and calling for proposals on this system.

In 1990, about 200,000 people, most of them from the USSR, immigrated to Israel. This group included almost 50,000 women of childbearing age. In the USSR, abortion is extremely frequent. Estimates of the number of legal and illegal abortions for 1988 range from 9.5-11 million. An average Soviet women has close to 5 abortions during her lifetime. Some of the reasons for such a high rate of abortion include the lack of available contraceptives, the exaggeration of the possible dangers of modern contraceptives on the part of Soviet physicians, and the social and psychological acceptance of abortion by Soviet women as a routine medical procedure. Considering the number of AFLA from earlier Soviet immigrants, requests for abortions will increase. Data from 1988 indicates that USSR-born Israeli women (who arrived during a wave of immigration in the 1970s) had a general rate of AFLA 26% higher than the total rate for Jewish Israeli women. And for women age 20-29, the AFLA rate was 50% higher for USSR-born women than for Israeli women. The article estimates that the wave of new arrivals will lead to a 10% increase in the number of AFLA. The new wave of Soviet immigrants means that the government will need to expand its family planning services. The immediate implication of the family planning services. The immediate implication of the influx, though, is that the government will need to establish additional abortion medical committees to guarantee fair access to abortion. But since many of the would be aborting Soviet women are married, many will not meet the current abortion law criteria, and this will lead to an increase in the number of illegal abortions.","","Abortion Applicants; Abortion, Criminal; Abortion, Induced; Abortion, Legal; Asia; Asia, Western; Demography; Developed Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Family Planning; Israel; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; USSR; Abortion Rate; Abortion Seekers; Abortion, Illegal; Abortion, Induced; Abortion, Legal; Asia; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Family Planning; Fertility Control, Postconception; International Migration; Israel; Mediterranean Countries; Migrants; Migration; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Research Report; Ussr; Western Asia; abortion rate; abortion; Abortion Seekers; Abortion, Illegal; article; Asia; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; family planning; Fertility Control, Postconception; illegal abortion; induced abortion; International Migration; Israel; Mediterranean Countries; Migrants; migration; population; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; Research Report; therapeutic abortion; USSR; Western Asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10178538","","","12284556","English","Plan Parent Eur","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026212591"

Available evidence suggests that internal and international migration involves a large number of persons. These migrations are very likely to continue and perhaps increase in the future. A large population base continues to record relatively high annual rates of growth, widening economic differentials between West African and developed countries, as well as economic differentials between and within West African countries. Migration caused by civil wars and ethnic rivalry are not likely to abate in the immediate future. Furthermore, the success of ECOWAS will generate greater migration within the subregion.","","Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Africa, Northern; Africa, Western; Burkina Faso; Cote d'Ivoire; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Ghana; Nigeria; Politics; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Research Design; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; Africa, (West); Africa; Africa South Of The Sahara; Brain Drain; Burkina Faso; Case Studies; Data Analysis; Data Quality; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Emigrants; English Speaking Africa; French Speaking Africa; Ghana; International Migration; Ivory Coast; Labor Migration; Literature Review; Migrants; Migration; Nigeria; Political Factors; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Socioeconomic Factors; Studies; Western Africa; economic incentive; emigration; migration dynamics; migration flows; refugees; Africa; Africa south of the Sahara; article; Brain Drain; Burkina Faso; case report; case study; Cote d'Ivoire; data analysis; Data Quality; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Economic Factors; economics; Emigrants; English Speaking Africa; French Speaking Africa; Ghana; International Migration; Labor Migration; Literature Review; methodology; Migrants; migration; Nigeria; Political Factors; politics; population; population dynamics; research; socioeconomics; statistics; Studies; Western Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00207985","","","12347008","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029415331"

Data were obtained from the 1970 and 1980 Korean Population Census and Korean Municipal Yearbook on cities with a minimum size of 20,000-50,000 people (108 cities and towns). Urban growth is most strongly influenced by indigenous labor surplus and the population potential of the city to be in contact with another city. Nine multiple regression variables explained just under 66% of the variance in urban growth. Net migration was influential among those aged 15-24 years. The extent of differentiation of industry affected net migration only among those aged 15-24 years and those aged 35-44 years. Population redistribution was more affected directly by changes in industrial organization, and migration was affected indirectly by environmental and technological effects on organization. Urban growth through migration of older age groups was affected by government expenditure on public works. Urban growth was not much affected by transportation/communication concentration, manufacturing concentration, urban labor surplus, population size, and site. Urban growth was viewed as the interaction between the unemployment rate and the urban wage, following Todaro's equilibrium models. In Korea, larger cities only grew faster during the 1960s. By the 1970s, upper middle-sized cities grew faster. Location was not a significant factor in explaining urban growth, but growth was rapid along a corridor within 100 km from Seoul and 50 km from Pusan, the second largest city in Korea. Caution was urged in interpreting Korea's ecological urban growth patterns as indicative of developing countries.","","Asia; Demography; Developing Countries; Ecology; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Environment; Far East; Financial Management; Geography; Health Expenditures; Industry; Korea; Multivariate Analysis; Population; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Research; Residential Mobility; Statistics; Transportation; Unemployment; Urban Population; Urbanization; Asia; Correlation Studies; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Ecology; Economic Factors; Employment; Environment; Expenditures; Financial Activities; Geographic Factors; Industry; Korea; Macroeconomic Factors; Migration; Multivariate Analysis; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Population Size; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; Spatial Distribution; Statistical Studies; Studies; Transportation; Unemployment; Urban Spatial Distribution; Urbanization; spatial distribution; article; Asia; Correlation Studies; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Eastern Asia; ecology; Economic Factors; economics; employment; environment; Expenditures; Far East; Financial Activities; financial management; Geographic Factors; geography; health care cost; industry; Korea; Macroeconomic Factors; migration; multivariate analysis; population; population density; population dynamics; population growth; population size; research; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; Statistical Studies; Studies; traffic and transport; unemployment; urban population; Urban Spatial Distribution; urbanization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12253804","","","12345852","English","Korea J Popul Dev","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028477622"

In Soweto, government, the African National Congress, nongovernmental organizations, and organized industry and labor representatives worked for 2 days to develop a national plan of action, but it did not result in a united effort to fight AIDS. The highest HIV infection rates in South Africa are among the KwaZulu in Natal, yet the Inkatha Freedom Party did not attend NACOSA. This episode exemplifies the key obstacles for South Africa to prevent and control AIDS. Inequality of access to health care may explain why health workers did not diagnose the first AIDS case in blacks until 1985. Migrant labor, Bantu education, and uprooted communities affect the epidemiology of HIV infection. Further, political and social polarization between blacks and whites contributes to a mindset that AIDS is limited to the other race which only diminishes the personal and collective sense of susceptibility and the volition and aptitude to act. The Department of National Health and Population Development's voluntary register of anonymously reported cases of AIDS specifies 1517 cumulative AIDS cases (October 1992), but this number is low. Seroprevalence studies show between 400,000-450,000 HIV positive cases. Public hospitals cannot give AIDS patients AZT and DDI. Few communities provided community-based care. Not all hospitals honor confidentiality and patients' need for autonomy. Even though HIV testing is not mandatory, it is required sometimes, e.g., HIV testing of immigrants. AIDS Training, Information and Counselling Centers are in urban areas, but not in poor areas where the need is most acute. The government just recently developed in AIDS education package for schools, but too many people consider it improper, so it is not being used. The poor quality education provided blacks would make it useless anyhow. Lifting of the academic boycott will allow South African researchers to catch up with AIDS research.","","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Africa, Southern; AIDS Serodiagnosis; Automatic Data Processing; Blacks; Culture; Demography; Developing Countries; Diagnosis; Disease; Economics; Education; Emigration and Immigration; Epidemiologic Methods; Ethnic Groups; Evaluation Studies; Health Education; Health Services Accessibility; HIV Infections; Interpersonal Relations; Laboratory Techniques and Procedures; Organization and Administration; Politics; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Poverty; Program Evaluation; Records; Research; Socioeconomic Factors; South Africa; Transients and Migrants; Virus Diseases; Whites; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome--prevention and control; Africa; Africa South Of The Sahara; Blacks; Critique; Cultural Background; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Diseases; Economic Factors; Education; English Speaking Africa; Epidemiologic Methods; Ethnic Groups; Examinations And Diagnoses; Gender Issues; Gender Relations; Health Education; Hiv Infections--prevention and control; Hiv Serodiagnosis; Inequalities; Information; Information Processing; Labor Migration; Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; Migration; Obstacles; Organization And Administration; Political Factors; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Poverty; Program Accessibility; Program Evaluation; Programs; Records; Research Activities; Research Methodology; Socioeconomic Factors; South Africa; Southern Africa; Viral Diseases; Whites; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome--prevention and control; Africa; Africa south of the Sahara; article; Caucasian; Critique; cultural anthropology; Cultural Background; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; diagnosis; diagnosis, measurement and analysis; Diseases; Economic Factors; economics; education; English Speaking Africa; epidemiology; ethnic group; Examinations And Diagnoses; Gender Issues; Gender Relations; general aspects of disease; health care delivery; health care quality; health education; Hiv Infections--prevention and control; Hiv Serodiagnosis; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; human relation; Inequalities; information; information processing; Labor Migration; Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; migration; negro; Obstacles; organization and management; Political Factors; politics; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; poverty; Program Accessibility; Programs; research; Research Activities; Research Methodology; serodiagnosis; socioeconomics; South Africa; Southern Africa; Viral Diseases; virus infection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10550380","","","12317931","English","AIDS Soc","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027349458"

Being this source an instrument of control by the State on emigrastion flows, the major question regarding passport registers concerns the level of clandestine emigration. Thus a comparison with U.S. ship lists reveals two different pictures of Portuguese emigration in sex ratio, occupations and age distribution.

The higher the female educational level, the higher the FLFP and the fewer children even born. The higher the male median income, the lower the FLFP of married women, and the higher the female median income, the greater the number of FLFP of married women. The higher the % of Roman Catholics, the lower the FLFP and the greater the number of children ever born. The greater the proportion of foreign born, the fewer children ever born. The higher the proportion of owner occupied dwellings, the greater the number of children ever born. 2 stage least squares were used in the analysis in a reduced form of equation by regressing the dependent variables on the predictor variables, and then the reduced form vs substituted for each department variable and estimated by ordinary least squares. Analyses were performed for 1971, 81, and the change between years, which uses residualized change scores of both the dependent and independent variables to express change. The results indicate that between 1971 and 81 the greatest change was in FLFP which increased 14%. Zero order correlations confirmed that the predictor variables for higher FLFP were higher education, higher female income, lower male income, and lower proportion of Roman Catholics. Significant correlates with FLFP in 1971 were proportion of foreign born, Roman Catholic, and children ever born. Correlates of children ever born in 1971 were proportion of Roman Catholic and foreign born, and by 1981 all predictors except male income and owner occupied dwellings. FLFP and children ever born are strongly and negatively related to each other. Multivariate analyses reveal multicollinearity among education and female income, so female income is dropped. Bivariate results are confirmed. Children ever born has a negative effect on FLFP when socioeconomic and cultural variables are controlled for. In 1981, the largest coefficients are for male income and foreign born and with own occupied dwellings, these 3 are the best predictors of children ever born. In the change analyses, the effect of children ever born on FLFP is slightly greater than the effect of FLFP on children ever born. Results support Waite and Stolzenbergs and DeFronzo's research but refute Smith-Levin and Tickamyer.","","Americas; Birth Rate; Canada; Demography; Developed Countries; Economics; Educational Status; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Ethnic Groups; Fertility; Health Manpower; Income; North America; Parity; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Regression Analysis; Religion; Research; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Americas; Canada; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Economic Factors; Educational Status; Fertility; Fertility Determinants; Fertility Measurements; Foreigners; Human Resources; Income--men; Income--women; Labor Force--determinants; Labor Force--women; Nationality; North America; Northern America; Parity; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Religion; Research Methodology; Research Report; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Statistical Regression; article; birth rate; Canada; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; Economic Factors; economics; employment; ethnic group; fertility; Fertility Determinants; Fertility Measurements; Foreigners; health care manpower; Human Resources; income; Income--men; Income--women; Labor Force--determinants; Labor Force--women; migration; Nationality; North America; Northern America; parity; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; regression analysis; religion; research; Research Methodology; Research Report; social class; social status; socioeconomics; Statistical Regression; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00166987","","","12284821","English","Genus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025718326"

Health impact assessments (HIAs) seek to estimate this impact, but they often do so by measuring intermediate or proxy indicators and factors that act to determine health. These measures frequently assume a static population. However, regeneration policies can work hard for several years to no apparent effect. One explanation could be migration. Families who have benefited move from the area and other, perhaps more deprived, families move in. Conversely, healthy, prosperous families may move into an improved area, giving the impression that the health of the population has changed, when in fact it is the actual population that has changed. Census data in England and Wales show that a positive correlation exists between migration within wards and deprivation scores. This paper explores the possible implications of migration for HIA. The census, NHS central register, electoral register, labour force survey, central index of the Department of Social Security, council tax database and other data sources are examined to identify what migration data are available at a local level. Factors that determine rates of migration at a local level have been reviewed, with special reference to the differences between population subgroups. The paper concludes with recommendations to take account of residential mobility and changes in migration patterns when carrying out HIAs. © 2003 The Royal Institute of Public Health.

Combination with other nominal sources allowed to bring out the role played by women in the organization and maintenance of kin and neighborhood networks. The approach to the Italian diaspora abroad requires the linkage of different nominal sources at origin and in the different places of destination. A research agenda should include the analysis of gender in the construction of migration chains, a cross-cultural analysis of women's work as well as an analysis of how Italian family ,economies functioned in an internacional labor market of mobile men and more-settled women. The study of the Italian diaspora requires also a collective approach to research.","","Americas; Data Collection; Demography; Developed Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Europe; Family Characteristics; Geography; Italy; North America; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Research Design; Residence Characteristics; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; United States; Women's Rights; USA; Americas; Data Analysis; Data Collection; Data Linkage; Data Quality; Data Sources; Demographic Factors; Destination; Developed Countries; Economic Factors; Employment--women; Europe; Family And Household; Family Characteristics; Geographic Factors; International Migration; Italy; Macroeconomic Factors; Mediterranean Countries; Migration; Neighborhood; North America; Northern America; Origin; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Residence Characteristics; Socioeconomic Factors; Southern Europe; Spatial Distribution; United States; Women's Status; census; demographic history; international migration; methodology; article; data analysis; Data Linkage; Data Quality; Data Sources; Demographic Factors; demography; Destination; developed country; Economic Factors; economics; employment; Employment--women; Europe; Family And Household; family size; Geographic Factors; geography; information processing; International Migration; Italy; Macroeconomic Factors; Mediterranean Countries; methodology; migration; neighborhood; North America; Northern America; Origin; population; population dynamics; research; socioeconomics; Southern Europe; spatial distribution; statistics; United States; Western Hemisphere; women's rights; Women's Status","","","","","",""," Congreso Internacional de Ciencias Históricas, (1995); Barton J., Peasants and Strangers: Italians, Rumanians and Slovaks in An American CIty, 1850-1950, (1975); Briggs J., An Italian Passage: Immigrants to Three American Cities, 1890-1930, (1978); Kessner T., The Golden Door: Italian and Jewish Immigrant Mobility in New York City, 1880-1915, (1977); Yans-McLaughlin V., Family and Community; Italian Immigrants in Buffalo, 1880-1930, (1977); Gabaccia D., From Sicily to Elizabeth Street; Housing and Social Change among Italian Immigrants, 1880-1930, (1984); Smith J.E., Family Connections: A History of Italian and Jewish Immigrant Lives in Providence, Rhode Island, 1900-1940, (1985); Cohen M., Workshop to Office, Two Generations of Italian Women in New York City, 1900-1950, (1992); Anderson M.J., The American Census: A Social History, (1988); Annual Reports, (1908); Willcox W.F., International Migrations, 2, (1931); Yans-McLaughlin V., Family and Community; Gabaccia, From Sicily to Elizabeth Street; Estellie Smith M., Networks and Migration Resettlement: Cherchez la Femme, Anthropological Quarterly, 49, pp. 20-27, (1976); Cohen M., Italian American Women in New York City, 1900-1950: Work and School; Yans-McLaughlin V., Italian Women and Work: Experience and Perception, Class, Sex and the Woman Worker, pp. 120-143, (1977); Pleck E., A Mother's Wages: A Comparison of Income-Earning among Urban Black and Italian Married Women, 1896-1911, The American Family in Socio-Historical Perspective, pp. 490-510, (1978); Smith, Family Connections; Yans-McLaughlin, Family and Community; Gabaccia, From Sicily to Elizabeth Street; Smith, Family Connections; Willett M.H., The Employment of Women in the Clothing Trade, (1902); Gabaccia, From Sicily to Elizabeth Street; Tilly L.A., Scott J.W., Women, Work, and Family, pp. 1-2, (1978); Smith, Family Connections, pp. 75-76; Yans-McLaughlin, Family and Community; Briggs J., Fertility and Cultural Change among Families in Italy and America, American Historical Review, 91, pp. 1129-1145, (1986); Watkins S.C., After Ellis Island: Newcomers and Natives in the 1910 Census, (1994); Gabaccia, From Sicily to Elizabeth Street, pp. 75-76; Smith, Family Connections, pp. 114-115; Smith, Family Connections; Gabaccia, From Sicily to Elizabeth Street, pp. 79-80; Di Leonardo M., The Female World of Cards and Holidays: Women, Families, and the Work of Kinship, Signs, 12, pp. 440-453, (1987); Yans-McLaughlin, Family and Community; Smith, Family Connections, 4; Gabaccia D., From the Other Side: Women and Gender in Immigrant Life, 1820-1990, (1995); Bodnar J., The Transplanted, A History of Immigrants in Urban America, (1985); Harzig C., Et al., Peasant Maids, City Women; Bezza B., Gli Italiani Fuori D' Italia: Gli Emigrati Italiani Nei Movimenti Operai dei Paesi D' Adozione 1880-1940, (1993); Pozzetta G.E., Ramirez B., The Italian Diaspora Across the Globe: Essays in Honour of Robert F.

This paper provides a more systematic analysis of these statistics. It focuses on the pattern of origins and destinations for asylum seekers in the European Union in the period 1985-1994. Asylum seekers from a particular country of origin often tend to go to a particular country within the European Union. Most of these cases can be attributed to historical ties between the sending and receiving country. When the patterns of origin and destinations are compared for separate years, it becomes clear that the destinations of asylum movements have been constantly changing. Though some of the more remarkable shifts were clearly related to policy measures in the relevant countries, many measures produced only limited effects or failed to have any effect at all.","","Demography; Developed Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Europe; Organization and Administration; Population; Population Dynamics; Program Evaluation; Public Policy; Refugees; Research; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; Europe; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Destination; Developed Countries; Europe; Migrants; Migration; Migration Policy; Organization And Administration; Origin; Policy; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Policy; Program Effectiveness; Program Evaluation; Programs; Refugees; Research Methodology; Social Policy; asylum seekers; European Union; immigration policy; refugees; article; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; Destination; developed country; Europe; health care quality; methodology; Migrants; migration; Migration Policy; organization and management; Origin; policy; population; population dynamics; Population Policy; Program Effectiveness; Programs; refugee; research; statistics","","","","","","","Adepoju A., The Dynamics of Emigration: Sub-Saharan Africa, Causes of International Migration, pp. 187-200, (1995); Black R., Refugees and Asylum-seekers in Western Europe: New Challenges, Geography and Refugees: Patterns and Processes of Change, pp. 88-103, (1993); Brochmann G., Bosnian Refugees in the Nordic Countries.

They are hunters and gatherers who typically reside in settlements of 3-13 small huts under trees near forests and hillocks. This paper looks at the adaptation to changes in socioeconomic and living conditions of the subpopulation of Chenchus residing in Chenchupally village. Findings are based upon case studies, field observations, village socioeconomic profiles, census publications, and other literature. The village of 45 families in houses together with supporting infrastructure was build in 1980-81 under a resettlement program to rehabilitate scattered Chenchu families living in abject poverty. 40 of the families were also provided 3 acres of land each for agricultural purposes. It is clear that the people of Chenchupally have a positive and encouraging ability in many ways to adapt to change, but are limited in other ways by the continued observance by some members of traditional practices and taboos. Nonetheless, these Chenchu are slowly adapting to permanent settlement and a new environment in the plains. They have switched to agriculture and other wage labor distinct from their traditional mode of living, they are enthusiastically rearing cattle, and they are increasingly embracing a small family norm and the need to educate their children in schools. It is hoped that these findings expand the perspective on tribes in the state.","","Agriculture; Asia; Culture; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Education; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Groups; Family Characteristics; Geography; Income; India; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research; Residence Characteristics; Rural Population; Social Change; Social Planning; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Taboo; Agricultural Development; Asia; Cultural Background; Culture; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Development; Economic Factors; Education; Ethnic Groups; Family And Household; Family Characteristics; Family Size; Family Size, Desired; Geographic Factors; Income; India; Migration; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Research Report; Residence Characteristics; Rural Development; Rural Population; Settlement And Resettlement; Social Change; Socioeconomic Factors; Southern Asia; Spatial Distribution; Standard Of Living; Taboo; Tribes; spatial distribution; Agricultural Development; agriculture; article; Asia; cultural anthropology; Cultural Background; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; economic development; Economic Factors; economics; education; ethnic group; Family And Household; family size; Family Size, Desired; Geographic Factors; geography; income; India; migration; policy; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; Research Report; Rural Development; rural population; Settlement And Resettlement; socioeconomics; sociology; Southern Asia; Standard Of Living; Tribes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00251569","","","12286967","English","Man India","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026879548"

Data were collected from health centers in the city of Al-Khobar, with the multivariate dummy regression technique used to subsequently analyze the relationship between the dependent variable, the number of living children, and explanatory variables. Wife's age, the husband-wide age difference, and wife's education were found to be significantly associated with the number of living children. Wife's education has the largest influence upon fertility, with fertility decreasing as education level increases. Fertility also varies directly with husband-wife age differences, with increasing numbers of living children observed for greater age differences. Neither husband's education, family income, nor occupation were significantly related to the number of living children. The paper qualifies its results in noting the study's sample selection bias. Since all migrants who did not bring their families with them to Saudi Arabia were excluded from the study, results are based upon better-educated and comparatively well-off economically migrants.","","Age Factors; Asia; Asia, Western; Birth Rate; Comparative Study; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Educational Status; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Family Characteristics; Family Planning Policy; Fertility; Health Manpower; Income; Islam; Marriage; Middle East; Multivariate Analysis; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Public Policy; Regression Analysis; Religion; Research; Saudi Arabia; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; Age Factors; Arab Countries; Asia; Comparative Studies; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Educational Status--women; Employment; Family And Household; Family Characteristics; Family Size; Family Size, Desired; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; High Fertility Population; Household Consumption; Human Resources; Husband-wife Comparisons; Income; International Migration; Islam; Labor Force; Labor Migration; Low Fertility Population; Macroeconomic Factors; Microeconomic Factors; Migrants; Migration; Multivariate Analysis; Own Children Data; Policy; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Policy; Pronatalist Policy; Religion; Research Methodology; Research Report; Saudi Arabia; Social Policy; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Statistical Regression; Studies; Western Asia; age; Arab Countries; article; Asia; birth control; birth rate; Comparative Studies; comparative study; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Economic Factors; economics; Educational Status--women; employment; Family And Household; family size; Family Size, Desired; fertility; Fertility Measurements; health care manpower; High Fertility Population; Household Consumption; Human Resources; Husband-wife Comparisons; income; International Migration; Labor Force; Labor Migration; Low Fertility Population; Macroeconomic Factors; marriage; Microeconomic Factors; Middle East; Migrants; migration; multivariate analysis; Own Children Data; policy; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; population growth; Population Policy; Pronatalist Policy; regression analysis; religion; research; Research Methodology; Research Report; Saudi Arabia; social class; social status; socioeconomics; Statistical Regression; Studies; Western Asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12284317","English","Popul Sci","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025449676"

A detailed review of interconnections among individual behavior, household strategies, community structures, and national political economies indicates that inter-level and inter-temporal dependencies are inherent to the migration process and give it a strong internal momentum. The dynamic interplay between network growth and individual migration labor, migration remittances, and local income distributions all create powerful feedback mechanisms that lead to the cumulative causation of migration. These mechanisms are reinforced and shaped by macrolevel relationships within the larger political economy.","","Behavior; Communication; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Making; Demography; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Evaluation Studies; Family Characteristics; Feedback; Information Services; Longitudinal Studies; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Social Sciences; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; Behavior; Communication; Cost Benefit Analysis; Data Analysis; Decision Making; Demographic Factors; Demography; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Evaluation; Evaluation Methodology; Family And Household; Feedback; Information Networks; Labor Migration--determinants; Literature Review; Longitudinal Studies; Macroeconomic Factors; Mathematical Model; Microeconomic Factors; Migration--determinants; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Theory; Quantitative Evaluation; Remittances; Research Methodology; Social Sciences; Studies; MLCS; MLOWN; article; behavior; cost benefit analysis; data analysis; decision making; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; developing country; Economic Factors; economics; evaluation; Evaluation Methodology; Family And Household; family size; feedback system; Information Networks; information service; interpersonal communication; Labor Migration--determinants; Literature Review; longitudinal study; Macroeconomic Factors; mathematical model; methodology; Microeconomic Factors; migration; Migration--determinants; population; population dynamics; Population Theory; Quantitative Evaluation; Remittances; research; sociology; statistics; Studies; theoretical model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00324701","","","12316385","English","Popul Index","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025400246"

The economic attainment patterns of males born in 92 countries of the world are examined and are compared among themselves, as well as among the seven principal US-born groups of Anglos, Afro-American, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cuban Americans, Asian Americans, and American Indians. For all foreign-born groups, the article examines the degree to which such individual-level factors as educational attainment, labor market experience, and so forth account for their variation in economic attainment. We conclude that although microlevel characteristics are not the complete answer, they are important for most foreign-born populations in explaining their variation in earnings. -Author","","Americas; Demography; Developed Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Groups; Income; North America; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; United States; USA; Americas; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Economic Factors; Foreigners--men; Immigrants--men; Income--men; Migrants; Migration; Nationality; North America; Northern America; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research Report; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status--men; United States; attainment pattern; economic status; foreign-born population; personal characteristics; wage difference; article; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; Economic Factors; economics; ethnic group; Foreigners--men; Immigrants--men; income; Income--men; Migrants; migration; Nationality; North America; Northern America; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; Research Report; social class; Socioeconomic Status--men; socioeconomics; United States; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01979183","","","12345791","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028586960"

Evidence is reviewed on increasing degradation in the forms of deforestation (of highland forests as well as lowland forests), soil erosion and soil desiccation. The conceptual framework considers changes in demographics as well as economic behaviour being induced by population growth and increasing pressures upon the land, but the focus here is on economic changes in the form of land extensification-often involving internal migration-and land intenstification. Despite data problems, the expected relationships are observed: countries with higher rural population growth tend to have larger increases in the arable land area and associated deforestation, but the intensification effects appear stronger.

In the US 47% of people between the ages of 25 and 44 have lived with an unmarried partner for some period, up from 37% during 1987-1988. For teenagers, absence of contact with fathers is associated with symptoms of depression, becoming a teen parent, and delinquency. Single fathers in 1990 were younger and had lower incomes than in the past. About 40% of nonpaying fathers had children out of wedlock; 30% to 48% had low or no income. The tendency of Whites to leave or avoid minority neighborhoods is due to perceptions about crime, quality of the schools, neighborhood deterioration, and the socioeconomic level of neighbors. Although African-American death rates generally are higher than those of Whites, the pattern seems to reverse itself after age 85. Surprisingly, survival probability at ages 80-95 for US Whites is higher than that in Europe and Japan. When immigrants enter an area, there is not much evidence of low-skilled native-born people moving out. Families with undocumented heads received an average of $6,080 in welfare benefits, while refugees received $10,444. The Social Security system is shifting large amounts of money from regions of the country with younger age structures, such as California, to states with older age structures, such as Florida. Among other topics, the remarkably low total fertility rate of 3.4 in the Bangladesh 1993-1994 Demographic and Health Survey was questioned as biased; the infant mortality data for Tajikistan appeared to be suspect; the diffusion of information about family planning in Africa was mentioned; the significance of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development regarding reproductive health services was hailed; and USAID's designing of indicators in safe pregnancy, breastfeeding, and women's nutrition was related.","","Americas; Congresses; Demography; Developed Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Family Characteristics; Family Relations; Fathers; Marriage; North America; Parents; Politics; Population; Population Dynamics; Race Relations; Research; Research Design; Social Welfare; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; United States; Americas; Conferences And Congresses; Consensual Union; Data Analysis; Data Quality; Demographic Aging; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Economic Factors; Family And Household; Family Characteristics; Family Relationships; Fathers; Immigrants; Migrants; Migration; North America; Northern America; Nuptiality; Parents; Political Factors; Population; Population Dynamics; Race Relations; Research Methodology; Social Welfare; United States; nuptiality; article; Conferences And Congresses; Consensual Union; data analysis; Data Quality; Demographic Aging; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; Economic Factors; economics; family; Family And Household; Family Relationships; family size; father; Immigrants; marriage; methodology; Migrants; migration; North America; Northern America; parent; Political Factors; politics; population; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; social problem; social welfare; United States; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","07492448","","","12289924","English","Popul Today","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029317281"

Between 1975-80, 1.3 million people migrated to urban centers, 56% of whom were females. Furthermore, a 1980 census indicates that 13% of all urban migrants were females age 15-19, and almost 1/4 of them were women in their 20s. Figures also show that single females make up a substantial portion of the urban migrants. Compared to the men migrating into the cities, the female urban migrants had lower educational attainments. Many of uneducated migrants do not integrate as easily, and are relegated to the periphery of urban centers. The search for employment serves as the driving force for urban migration, and in fact, the level of female participation in the workforce is high. But while male migrants work mostly as craftsmen or in the production sector, most female migrants work in the service sector. This category includes domestic workers, laundry women, cooks and waitresses, hospitality girls, and prostitutes. Generally attracting single, young females, the service sector has easy entry, which helps explain the high rate of female employment. The author explains that this trend is cause for concern, considering that the number of people involved is large, that the service sector provides low earning, and that it lends itself to the exploitation of the workers. Nonetheless, the author says that the migration pattern might only be transitory, and the urban migration might be a liberating process for women, but explains that further research is needed concerning the upward mobility of urban migrants.","","Adolescent; Age Factors; Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Educational Status; Emigration and Immigration; Health Manpower; Marital Status; Marriage; Occupations; Philippines; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research; Residential Mobility; Single Person; Social Class; Social Mobility; Social Planning; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; Age Factors; Asia; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Development Planning; Economic Factors; Educational Status; Five-year Plans; Human Resources; Labor Migration; Marital Status; Migration; Nuptiality; Occupations; Philippines; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Statistics; Research Methodology; Research Report; Rural-urban Migration; Social Class; Social Mobility; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Southeastern Asia; Unmarried--women; Youth--women; nuptiality; adolescent; age; article; Asia; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Development Planning; Economic Factors; economics; family size; Five-year Plans; health care manpower; Human Resources; Labor Migration; marriage; migration; occupation; Philippines; policy; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; Population Statistics; research; Research Methodology; Research Report; Rural-urban Migration; social class; social status; socioeconomics; Southeast Asia; Southeastern Asia; Unmarried--women; Youth--women","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12343164","English","Popul Forum","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025616607"

At these heights they can use the wind to travel tens or-hundreds of kilometers in a single flight, and hence a knowledge of their movements is essential to understanding their ecology and population dynamics. Direct observation of high-flying insect migrants is very difficult, especially at night, but the remote sensing capabilities of entomological radar provide a solution to this seemingly intractable problem. We describe a novel, nutating-beam, vertical-looking radar with autonomous data analysis software. This system routinely extracts data on size, shape, alignment, and displacement vectors from individual targets, allowing long-term monitoring of migrant insect populations. We discuss the capabilities and limitations of this system and describe some of its applications in the study of insect migration behaviour.","Diamondback moth; Flight; Insect monitoring; Orientation; Radar entomology","Insecta; Lepidoptera; Plutella xylostella","","","","","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, BBSRC, (206/D15558)","We thank Ian Woiwod, Joe Riley, and Elspeth Bartlet for comments.

Both the spread of HIV 1 infection in the 1980s, and the subsequent development of AIDS to its 1990 spatial pattern, are shown to be significantly and positively correlated with ethnic patterns of recruitment into the Ugandan National Liberation Army (UNLA) after the overthrow of Idi Amin some 10 years earlier in 1979. This correlation reflects the estimated mean incubation period of 8–10 years for HIV 1 and underlines the need for cognizance of historical factors which may have influenced current patterns of AIDS seen in Central Africa. The findings may have important implications for AIDS forecasting and control in African countries which have recently experienced war. The results are compared with parallel analyses of other HIV hypotheses advanced to account for the reported geographical distribution of AIDS in Uganda. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

One solution to this constraint is to try to construct the desired data using information from multiple data sources and prior information. Current methods for accomplishing this task tend to focus predominantly on updating transaction matrices (input-output tables, transportation flows, or interregional migration accounts) and emphasize an algorithmic approach to the problem. This paper attempts to broaden the applications and generalize the solution by extending the model-based approach to incomplete data analysis advocated by Willekens (1982). The log-linear model is presented here as a flexible platform for incomplete data analysis and a path diagram describes several alternative modeling approaches; different paths are determined by the level of available information. The paper concludes with an application to incomplete occupational migration and mobility tables. © 1999 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association) N.V.

Growth followed three phases. The first phase lasted from the 18th year of Shunzhi to the 24th year of Kangxi (from 1661 to 1685). This period was marked by war and natural disaster, which contributed to population declines. The second phase lasted from the 24th year of Kangxi to the 22nd year of Qianlong (from 1685 to 1757). During the second phase population growth increased at a faster rate under conditions of high immigration, social stability, and economic progress. The third phase lasted from the 22nd year of Qianlong to the 20th year of Daoguang (from 1757 to 1840). Population growth during this third period put pressure on the land and food production. Population growth declined. The original data indicate that men in the household increased from 13,839 in 1661 to 21,388. The number of households increased from 27,687 in 1732 to 629,835 in 1753. Population was an estimated 3,149,175 in 1753 and 5,410,035 in 1840. Revised population estimates indicate that population grew from 2,060,400 in 1661 to 4,574,900 in 1753 and to 5,410,035 in 1840. Some researchers estimate total population in 1661 as under or around 1 million rather than the author's 2 million. It is explained that early registers counted men who provided a capitation tax. The author's ratio of registered men to total population, or households to total population, is 1:5.7. It is argued that underestimation in records was due to the number of people fleeing Guizhou due to war and heavy taxation. There were several versions of the ""Annals of Guizhou,"" some of which were lost. Records were affected by the shift to a new system for organizing population in 1832, mistakes in recording, and the abolishment of the capitation taxation in 1786.","","Asia; Automatic Data Processing; China; Demography; Developing Countries; Far East; Population; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Records; Social Sciences; Asia; China; Demographic Factors; Demography; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Historical Demography; Historical Survey; Information; Information Processing; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Growth--history; Population Size--history; Records; Social Sciences; article; Asia; China; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Eastern Asia; Far East; Historical Demography; Historical Survey; information; information processing; population; population density; population dynamics; population growth; Population Growth--history; Population Size--history; sociology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10448403","","","12320979","English","Chin J Popul Sci","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030642392"

Using life history data from the 1983 Korean National Migration Survey, the authors examined the pattern of migrant adjustment by estimating the 1st difference form of the autoregressive equation. They found a disruptive effect of rural-to-urban migration that disappears gradually after migration. This study provides strong evidence that most rural-to-urban migrants successfully adapt to urban life through upward occupational mobility relative to both rural and urban natives. This finding sharply contrasts with previous studies on the urban informal sector, which emphasize selective rural-to-urban migration or the inability of migrating individuals to adapt to city life. Moreover, this study showed that a principle cause of the rapid expansion of Seoul is that migrants are more likely to be upwardly mobile when they are destined for Seoul rather than other cities. author's modified","","Acculturation; Asia; Cohort Studies; Comparative Study; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Groups; Far East; Health Planning; Korea; Organization and Administration; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Regression Analysis; Research; Research Design; Residential Mobility; Rural Population; Social Change; Social Class; Social Mobility; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; Urban Population; Acculturation; Asia; Cohort Analysis; Comparative Studies; Control Groups; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; Korea; Korea, Republic Of; Migrants; Migration; Nationality; Native-born; Organization And Administration; Planning; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Rural Population; Rural-urban Migration; Social Change; Social Class; Social Mobility; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Statistical Regression; Studies; Urban Population; article; Asia; cohort analysis; Comparative Studies; comparative study; control group; cultural factor; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; economics; ethnic group; Far East; health care planning; Korea; methodology; Migrants; migration; Nationality; Native-born; organization and management; planning; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; regression analysis; research; Research Methodology; rural population; Rural-urban Migration; social class; social status; socioeconomics; sociology; South Korea; Statistical Regression; Studies; urban population","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12253804","","","12343387","English","Korea J Popul Dev","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025523953"

Spatial mobility is not an isolated event that can be considered an independent variable; it is instead a process that can only be fully understood through its interaction with the other demographic, economic, political, and social elements that form part of the life of a human being. This work attempts to demonstrate the necessity of considering changes in these processes simultaneously, and briefly describes different methods of measurement. The study of migration has traditionally focused on a restricted concept of change of residence of individuals and has ignored other forms of population movement, such as commuting or repeated short-term movements not entailing permanent change of residence. Explanatory models of migration have been essentially cross-sectional, but a longitudinal approach is needed to analyze spatial mobility simultaneously with other events in the family and professional life. Retrospective studies may provide data on events in the past. They have the advantage of requiring only 1 visit, but the disadvantage that interviews may be quite lengthy. Some attempts to verify the quality of data collected in comprehensive retrospective biographical surveys in Belgium have yielded promising results. Respondents appear to remember the order of events better than the exact dates. It is more difficult to conduct retrospective surveys in developing countries because of the usual lack of population registers and other documentation. Prospective surveys appear more appropriate for obtaining longitudinal data on spatial mobility, but difficulties of following the sample for long periods of time then arise. Visits must be repeated at short enough intervals to avoid errors of memory, and arrangements must be made in advance for locating respondents who migrate. A hypothetical example of analysis of data on marital status and migration using data from a prospective study illustrates the use of nonparametric statistical techniques for this type of analysis. Parametric methods generalize the procedures of multiple regression, allowing functional dependencies to be identified. A large number of explanatory variables can be analyzed in parametric models, making them very useful for understanding interactions between migration, family life, professional life, etc. Semi-parametric models are a synthesis of parametric and non-parametric and offer advantages of each. A broader focus on spatial mobility could be enhanced by a closer cooperation of demography with other social sciences.","","Data Collection; Demography; Emigration and Immigration; English Abstract; Evaluation Studies; Methods; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Research Design; Residential Mobility; Sampling Studies; Social Sciences; Statistics; Critique; Data Analysis; Data Collection; Demographic Factors; Measurement; Methodological Studies; Migration; Migration, Internal--determinants; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Sampling Studies; Social Sciences; Studies; Survey Methodology; Surveys; World; article; Critique; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; epidemiology; information processing; measurement; Methodological Studies; methodology; migration; Migration, Internal--determinants; population; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; sociology; Studies; Survey Methodology; Surveys; technique; theoretical model; World","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03031829","","","12285188","Spanish","Notas Poblacion","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025465464"

Prior to 1984, China's urbanization had been slow and uneven. But in the 4 years from 1984-87, China's urban population grew 3.8 times faster than the period before 1984. and unlike the previous pattern of urbanization, slightly over half of the urban growth occurred in small cities and towns. The rapid growth of towns was due to an unprecedented level of in-migration into towns from agricultural villages. This population transformed itself into a nonagricultural population. The author attributes the increase in urbanization and its changing patterns to a historic convergence: the shift in industry for the agricultural population and a regional shift for the village population--realized through a form of village-to-town population migration. The author goes on to examine the development of small-town enterprises, facilitated after the rural reform of 1984. The author notes that since that year, small-town industries have flourished, a development that has had a number of beneficial effects on both the provincial areas and the nation as a whole. Finally, the author considers the factors that have fueled town population in-migration: 1) in most provinces, higher incomes in towns have attracted people from the villages; and 2) in provinces with little discrepancy in income between town and village, a combination of the regions' relative isolation and government policy preventing migration to cities have spurred the growth of towns.","","Agriculture; Asia; China; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Far East; Geography; Health Manpower; Income; Population; Population Dynamics; Public Policy; Research; Residential Mobility; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Urban Population; Urbanization; Agricultural Workers; Asia; China; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Economic Development; Economic Factors; Geographic Factors; Human Resources; Income; Labor Force; Macroeconomic Factors; Migration, Internal; Migration--beneficial effects; Policy; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Research Report; Rural-urban Migration; Socioeconomic Factors; Spatial Distribution; Urban Spatial Distribution; Urbanization--changes; spatial distribution; Agricultural Workers; agriculture; article; Asia; China; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Eastern Asia; economic development; Economic Factors; economics; employment; Far East; Geographic Factors; geography; health care manpower; Human Resources; income; Labor Force; Macroeconomic Factors; migration; Migration, Internal; Migration--beneficial effects; policy; population; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; Research Report; Rural-urban Migration; socioeconomics; urban population; Urban Spatial Distribution; urbanization; Urbanization--changes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10448403","","","12343588","English","Chin J Popul Sci","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025524055"

Data were obtained from the 1986 sample survey of 74 cities and towns and population migration. Migration is defined as crossing over an administrative urban area from an original place of residence for more than 1 year, regardless of whether the residence permit was changes or not. Monthly income/capita in 1978 and 1986 is the income measure. Correlations between income and migration generated by the Q index reveal that there is a positive correlation between migratory behavior and individual income in the urban population such that migrants income is higher than nonmigrants. The correlation becomes stronger over time, such that migrants' income is higher in 1986 than nonmigrants' in 1986. Correlation in 1978 was .191 and .341 in 1986, which indicates a weak relationship. The interpretation is that migrants move to increase income level, which is supported by research in the US and the USSR. The cultural and age composition of the migrant population also suggests that those with stronger capabilities are migrants. There is also regional disparity in workers' salaries, and the permit system before 1978 was restrictive. The stronger correlation in 1986 is attributed to policy changes and an increased level of socioeconomic development and ownership structure. The generally weak correlation is attributed to the state of developing economy where there does not yet exist full scale freedom of mobility, a full scale open labor market, or full scale competition for employment. There are 2 categories of population employment: salaried employees and gross national product i.e., one sector is protected by state economic and social welfare policies and another sector which is under restrictions. This phenomena is explicated in a diagram. Salary level does not reflect supply and demand. The correlations in 1978 for medium-sized cities showed the strongest positive correlation, followed by less strong correlations for small cities, and a low positive correlation for metropolises and large cities. There was a change in 1986 to large cities as the strongest positive correlation and stronger than in 1978 (.623 for large cities vs. .532 for medium-sized cities), followed by medium-sized cities and towns. Metropolises were still low. In the analyses by occupation, it appears that the distributions by occupation are not very different by size of city. The changes in large cities are due to the insulation from employment difficulties suffered by other cities, rapid increase in wages in regular occupations and for the in-migrant population not in full employment, unemployment was highest in the smaller cities, income disparity was decreased, and the income of migrants in business would be greater in large cities.","","Asia; China; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Far East; Income; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Public Policy; Research; Residential Mobility; Salaries and Fringe Benefits; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Unemployment; Urban Population; Asia; China; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Development Policy; Eastern Asia; Economic Development; Economic Factors; Employment; Employment Status; Income; Income Distribution; Macroeconomic Factors; Migration; Migration, Internal; Models, Theoretical; Occupational Status; Policy; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Unemployment; Urban Population; Wages; wage; article; Asia; China; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Development Policy; Eastern Asia; economic development; Economic Factors; economics; employment; Employment Status; Far East; income; Income Distribution; Macroeconomic Factors; migration; Migration, Internal; Occupational Status; personnel management; policy; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; social class; social status; socioeconomics; theoretical model; unemployment; urban population","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10448403","","","12343589","English","Chin J Popul Sci","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025524693"

The study concludes that the economic inequalities brought about by the uneven distribution of development projects in favor of urban areas causes depressed rural economic conditions, thus spurring rural to urban migration. Migration to the urban places of Ghana is therefore caused by individuals and families seeking better economic opportunities to improve the quality of their lives. Secondary determinants are varied, ranging from family obligations to the quest for adventure. The benefits of migration for the rural areas lie mainly in returned migrants' contributions to the economic development of those areas. Migrants also contribute to the urban areas' economic development, but their presence in large numbers has caused problems in the housing and in the delivery of social services. Rural development policies and land settlement schemes have been unsuccessful, due mainly to the lack of a comprehensive national development effort. © 1991 Springer.","","Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Africa, Western; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Family Characteristics; Ghana; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Quality of Life; Research; Residential Mobility; Rural Population; Social Planning; Social Welfare; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; Urban Population; Africa; Africa South Of The Sahara; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Development; Economic Factors; English Speaking Africa; Family And Household; Ghana; Households; Inequalities; Labor Migration; Microeconomic Factors; Migration; Migration, Internal; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Quality Of Life--changes; Remittances; Research Methodology; Research Report; Rural Development; Rural Population; Rural-urban Migration; Social Welfare; Socioeconomic Factors; Standard Of Living--changes; Urban Population; Western Africa; Africa; Africa south of the Sahara; article; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; economic development; Economic Factors; economics; English Speaking Africa; Family And Household; family size; Ghana; Households; Inequalities; Labor Migration; Microeconomic Factors; migration; Migration, Internal; policy; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; quality of life; Quality Of Life--changes; Remittances; research; Research Methodology; Research Report; Rural Development; rural population; Rural-urban Migration; social welfare; socioeconomics; Standard Of Living--changes; urban population; Western Africa","","","","","","","Shryock, Siegel, Stockwell, The Methods and Materials of Demography, (1976); Weeks, Population, (1986); Todaro M., Stilkind J., City Bias and Rural Neglect: The Dilemma of Urban Development, (1981); Osia, Black Africa and the dilemma of development, Journal of African Studies, 14, pp. 37-45, (1987); Allen, The Growth of Ghana’s Cities, (1979); Ward, Regional Development in Ghana: Prospects and Problems, (1976); Bhattacharyya B., The role of family decision in internal migration: The case of India, Journal of Development Economics, 18, pp. 51-56, (1985); Szereszewski T., Male Out-Migration in Northern Ghana, (1976); Adomako-Sarfo J., The Effects of the Expulsion of Migrant Workers on Ghana’s Economy, (1978); Caldwell J.C., African Rural-Urban Migration, (1969); Cole, Sanders, Internal migration and urban employment in the Third World, American Economic Review, 75, pp. 481-514, (1985); Turnham D., Jaeger I., The Employment Problem in Less Developed Countries, (1971); Kooperman, African urban planning and redevelopment, Journal of African Studies, 14, pp. 12-16, (1987); Hauser, World Population and Development, (1979)","","","Springer-Verlag","","","","","","19364814","","","12343871","English","Rev.

This includes, for example, the migration rates of hosts and parasites. In this respect, the current situation, especially in fluke-snail systems is unsatisfactory, since basic population genetics data are lacking and the appropriate methodology has rarely been used. After reviewing the forces acting on population structure (e.g. genetic drift or the mating system) and how they can be analysed in models of structured populations, we propose a simplified, indicative framework for conducting analyses of population structure in hosts and parasites. This includes consideration of markers, sampling, data analysis, comparison of structure in hosts and parasites and use of external data (e.g. from population dynamics). We then focus on flukes and snails, highlighting important biological traits with regard to population structure. The few available studies indicate that asexual amplification of flukes within snails strongly influences adult flukes populations. They also show that the genetic structure among populations in strongly affected by traits in other than snails (e.g. definitive host dispersal behaviour), as snails populations have limited migration. Finally more studies would allow us to deepen our current understanding of selective interference between flukes and snails (e.g. manipulation of host mating system by parasites), and evaluate how this affect population structure at neutral markers.","Coevolution; Flukes; Genetic markers; Population structure; Snails","evolution; genetic marker; host parasite interaction; mating; migration; nonhuman; population genetics; priority journal; review; snail; trematode","","","","","","","Anderson R.M., Gordon D.M., Processes influencing the distribution of parasite numbers within host populations with special emphasis on parasite-induced host mortalities, Parasitology, 85, pp. 373-398, (1982); Anderson T.J.C., Blouin M.S., Beech R.N., Population biology of parasitic nematodes: Applications of genetic markers, Advances in Parasitology, 41, pp. 219-283, (1998); Avise J.C., Molecular markers, Natural History and Evolution, (1994); Avise J.C., Phylogeography.

Box 959, Netherlands","The past decades, international migration has become increasingly important as a source of population growth in the Netherlands as well as in other West European countries. There is an interaction between international migration on the one hand and size and structure of the (non-native) population on the other. Migration flows bring about changes in the size and composition of the ‘stock’ of migrants, whereas the residing non-native population affects future migration flows. The up to now theoretical possibilities in linking immigrant flow and stock data in the Netherlands are improving rapidly. An important development is the introduction of a new computerized population registration system in the near future. One of the features in the new system is that each inhabitant will be identified by a unique identification number. This promises well for opportunities in matching data at the individual level. It is therefore expected that in the new situation it will be possible to better link immigrant stock and flow data. © 1993 IOS Press.

ROC 2Z0, P.O. Box 1160, Canada","Capture-recapture models are widely used to estimate demographic parameters of marked populations. Recently, this statistical theory has been extended to modeling dispersal of open populations. Multistate models can be used to estimate movement probabilities among subdivided populations if multiple sites are sampled. Frequently, however, sampling is limited to a single site. Models described by Burnham (1993, in Marked Individuals in the Study of Bird Populations, 199-213), which combined open population capture-recapture and band-recovery models, can be used to estimate permanent emigration when sampling is limited to a single population. Similarly, Kendall, Nichols, and Hines (1997, Ecology 51, 563-578) developed models to estimate temporary emigration under Pollock's (1982, Journal of Wildlife Management 46, 757-760) robust design. We describe a likelihood-based approach to simultaneously estimate temporary and permanent emigration when sampling is limited to a single population. We use a sampling design that combines the robust design and recoveries of individuals obtained immediately following each sampling period. We present a general form for our model where temporary emigration is a first-order Markov process, and we discuss more restrictive models. We illustrate these models with analysis of data on marked Canvasback ducks. Our analysis indicates that probability of permanent emigration for adult female Canvasbacks was 0.193 (SE= 0.082) and that birds that were present at the study area in year i - 1 had a higher probability of presence in year i than birds that were not present in year i - 1.","Band recovery; Breeding probability; Canvasbacks; Capture-recapture; Emigration; Jolly-Seber; Likelihood; Open populations; Robust design","Anas; Anas sp.; Aves; Aythya valisineria; Pollachius virens; Birds; Markov processes; Population statistics; Band recovery; Breeding probability; Canvasback; Capture-recapture; Capture-recapture models; Emigration; Jolly-seber; Likelihood; Open population; Robust designs; dispersal; mark-recapture method; population modeling; sampling; statistical analysis; biometry; Canada; data analysis; duck; migration; nonhuman; population dynamics; review; United States; Recovery","","","","","","","Anderson D.R., Sterling R.T., Population dynamics of molting pintail drakes banded in south-central Saskatchewan, Journal of Wildlife Management, 36, pp. 266-274, (1974); Anderson M.G., Rhymer J.M., Rohwer F.C., Philopatry and the genetic structure of waterfowl populations, Ecology and Management of Breeding Waterfowl, pp. 365-395, (1992); Anderson M.G., Emery R.B., Arnold T.W., Reproductive success and female survival affect local population density of Canvasbacks, Journal of Wildlife Management, 61, pp. 1174-1191, (1997); Arnason A.N., The estimation of population size, migration rate, and survival in a stratified population, Researches in Population Ecology, 15, pp. 1-8, (1973); Barker R.J., Joint modeling of live-recapture, tagresight, and tag-recovery data, Biometrics, 53, pp. 666-677, (1997); Bluhms P., Mednis A., Bauga I., Nichols J.D., Hines J.E., Age-specific survival and philopatry in three species of European ducks: A long-term study, Condor, 98, pp. 61-74, (1996); Brownie C., Anderson D.R., Burnham K.P., Robson D.S., Statistical inference from band recovery data: A handbook, 2nd edition, (1985); Brownie C., Hines J.E., Nichols J.D., Pollock K.H., Hestbeck J.B., Capture-recapture studies for multiple strata including non-Markovian transitions, Biometrics, 49, pp. 1173-1187, (1993); Burnham K.P., A theory for combined analysis of ring recovery and recapture data, The Use of Marked Individuals in the Study of Bird Populations: Models, Methods, and Software, pp. 199-214, (1993); Burnham K.P., Anderson D.R., Data-based selection of an appropriate biological model: The key to modern data analysis, Wildlife 2001: Population, pp. 16-30, (1992); Burnham K.P., Anderson D.R., Model Selection and Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach, (1998); Catchpole E.A., Freeman S.N., Morgan B.J.T., Harris M.P., Integrated recovery/recapture data analysis, Biometrics, 54, pp. 33-46, (1998); Clobert J., Lebreton J.-D., Allaine D., Galliard J.M., The estimation of age-specific breeding probabilities from recaptures or resightings in vertebrate populations: II.

The results suggest agricultural registration is clearly a deterrent to permanent migration, but it makes no difference with respect to temporary migration. Permanent migrants with agricultural registration predominantly move for noneconomic reasons, but those with nonagricultural registration are more likely motivated by economic reasons. The pattern is reversed in temporary migration. What accounts for the new patterns of spatial mobility are the changing market conditions associated with economic reforms. -from Author","","Asia; China; Data Collection; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Far East; Geography; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Residence Characteristics; Residential Mobility; Sampling Studies; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; China; Asia; China; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; Geographic Factors; Labor Migration; Migrants; Migration; Migration, Internal; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Residence Characteristics; Resident Status; Sampling Studies; Spatial Distribution; Studies; Surveys; Temporary Migration; spatial distribution; agricultural registration; developing country; economic reform; household registration; market conditions; migration; migration motive; spatial mobility; article; Asia; China; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; economics; epidemiology; Far East; Geographic Factors; geography; information processing; Labor Migration; Migrants; migration; Migration, Internal; population; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; Resident Status; Studies; Surveys; Temporary Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01979183","","","12286926","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027831912"

The overall picture conveyed by the Melanesian mobility literature emphasizes rural-based circular mobility as the predominant form of population mobility in the region. This article argues that much of the alleged continued predominance of circular mobility owes more to its underlying operationalizations, ways of measurement, and theoretical conceptualizations than reflects contemporary reality. This argument is substantiated by an analysis of recent developments in Vanuatu mobility set in the local and historical conditions of migration from the island of Paama. It is demonstrated how specific structural transformations on the island and in urban areas throughout this century were not only conducive to a change from temporary to long-term or permanent rural absences, but how they also have emerged as the direct result of mobility, thus highlighting the latter's dialectical nature. Evidence for this mobility change is derived from a comparative analysis of lifetime mobility histories of urban and rural Paamese men and women. -from Author","","Case Report; Demography; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Geography; Melanesia; Pacific Islands; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Residential Mobility; Social Change; Social Sciences; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; Urban Population; Urbanization; Vanuatu; Case Studies; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Demography; Developing Countries; Geographic Factors; Historical Demography; Labor Migration; Melanesia; Migration; Oceania; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; Social Change; Social Sciences; Spatial Distribution; Studies; Urban Spatial Distribution; Urbanization; spatial distribution; circular mobility; developing country; migration; mobility change; population migration; rural migration; temporary migration; urbanisation; article; case report; Case Studies; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Geographic Factors; geography; Historical Demography; Labor Migration; Melanesia; migration; Oceania; Pacific islands; population; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; sociology; Studies; urban population; Urban Spatial Distribution; urbanization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01979183","","","12317594","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027008106"

Design and Methods: We compared the traditional age-based definition of retirement migration and two retirement-based definitions, based on degree of labor-force participation and retirement income, by using the 2000 U.S. Census Public Use Microdata Sample. Results: The age-based definition overestimated the number of retired migrants, although the ranking of host and donor states remained relatively stable; nevertheless, states revealed different rates of change in inmigration and outmigration and income streams declined. Implications: Retirement-based definitions are more useful and precise for those researchers considering the economic implication of retirement migration.

In the past fifty years the birth rates have decreased by more than a half in both industrialized and developing countries. At the same time, life expectancy has doubled. In the lecture, facts and trends in fertility, mortality and migration are analyzed as causes of the population dynamics and current population predictions for Germany and Europe are presented. These data are then used as the basis for a concise survey of the most important conflicts of interest due to demographic factors at national and international levels (conflicts of interest between the young and old generations, between the new and the old provinces of Germany, between immigrants and non-immigrants, between people with children and those without). Finally, objectives, instruments, and chances of success of a population-conscious, interdisciplinary policy are discussed on the basis of international comparative analyses.

Principal co-ordinates of genetic distances and principal components analyses based on the haplotype frequencies show that the main genetic difference is attributed to the higher frequency of sub-Saharan L haplogroups in NW Africa, showing some gene flow across the Sahara desert, with a major impact in the southern populations of NW Africa. The AMOVA demonstrates that SW European populations are highly homogeneous whereas NW African populations display a more heterogeneous genetic pattern, due to an east-west differentiation as a result of gene flow coming from the East. Despite the shared haplogroups found in both areas, the European V and the NW African U6 haplogroups reveal the traces of the Mediterranean Sea permeability to female migrations, and allowed for determination and quantification of the genetic contribution of both shores to the genetic landscape of the geographic area. Comparison of mtDNA data with autosomal markers and Y-chromosome lineages, analysed in the same populations, shows a congruent pattern, although female-mediated gene flow seems to have been more intense than male-mediated gene flow. © University College London 2003.","","Analysis of Variance; DNA, Mitochondrial; Evolution, Molecular; Female; Genetics, Population; Geography; Haplotypes; Humans; Male; Mediterranean Region; Phylogeny; Population Dynamics; Principal Component Analysis; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Variation (Genetics); mitochondrial DNA; mitochondrial DNA; article; controlled study; data analysis; DNA sequence; female; gene flow; gene frequency; genetic difference; genetic distance; geography; haplotype; human; major clinical study; male; Mediterranean Sea; phylogeny; population genetic structure; population migration; population research; priority journal; promoter region; Southern Europe; Y chromosome; analysis of variance; comparative study; genetic variability; genetics; molecular evolution; phylogeny; population dynamics; population genetics; principal component analysis","","DNA, Mitochondrial, ","","","","","Anderson S., Bankier A.T., Barrell B.G., de Bruijn M.H., Coulson A.R., Drouin J., Eperon I.C., Nierlich D.P., Roe B.A., Sanger F., Schreier P.H., Smith A.J., Staden R., Young I.G., Sequence and organization of the human mitochondrial genome, Nature, 290, pp. 457-465, (1981); Andrews R.M., Kubacka I., Chinnery P.F., Lightowlers R.N., Turnbull D.M., Howell N., Reanalysis and revision of the Cambridge reference sequence for human mitochondrial DNA, Nat.

Only 50 (17.3%) of the combined group returnedfor their scheduled postpartum visit. Returning teens across groups were more likely to have no prenatal care, have a preterm or expired infant, report no educational plan, but have a support system. When controlling for marital status, Mexico-born married teens were the most likely to return for postpartum visits. Medical services need to focus on cultural norms andfamily support systems to increase use of health services.

It also examines the determinants of child survival in urban Bangladesh. Data come from the 1999-2000 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey. The results indicate that, although the indices of infant and child mortality are consistently better in urban areas, the urban-rural differentials in childhood mortality have diminished in recent years. The study identifies two distinct child morality regimes in urban Bangladesh: one for urban natives and one for rural-urban migrants. Under-five mortality is higher among children born to urban migrants compared with children born to life-long urban natives (102 and 62 per 1000 live births, respectively). The migrant-native mortality differentials more-or-less correspond with the differences in socioeconomic status. Like childhood mortality rates, rural-urban migrants seem to be moderately disadvantaged by economic status compared with their urban native counterparts. Within the urban areas, the child survival status is even worse among the migrant poor than among the average urban poor, especially recent migrants. This poor-non-poor differential in childhood mortality is higher in urban areas than in rural areas. The study findings indicate that rapid growth of the urban population in recent years due to rural-to-urban migration, coupled with higher risk of mortality among migrant's children, may be considered as one of the major explanations for slower decline in under-five mortality in urban Bangladesh, thus diminishing urban-rural differentials in childhood mortality in Bangladesh. The study demonstrates that housing conditions and access to safe drinking water and hygienic toilet facilities are the most critical determinants of child survival in urban areas, even after controlling for migration status. The findings of the study may have important policy implications for urban planning, highlighting the need to target migrant groups and the urban poor within urban areas in the provision of health care services. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.","","Bangladesh; Child; Child Mortality; Child, Preschool; Health Services; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Poverty; Proportional Hazards Models; Residential Mobility; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Transients and Migrants; Urban Population; adolescent; adult; aged; article; child health; childhood mortality; city planning; comparative study; consensus; data analysis; female; health care access; health care facility; health care planning; health care policy; high risk population; human; migration; rural area; rural population; sanitation; school child; social hygiene; social status; socioeconomics; survival; urban area; urban hygiene; urban population","","","","","","","Afsar R., Rural-Urban Migration in Bangladesh: Causes, Consequences and Challenges, (2000); Bangladesh Population Census 2001, (2003); Behm H., Vallin J., Mortality differentials among human groups, Biological and Social Aspects of Mortality and the Length of Life, pp. 11-37, (1982); Bender D.E., Rivera T., Madonna D., Rural origin as a risk factor for maternal and child health in peri-urban Bolivia, Social Science and Medicine, 37, 11, pp. 1345-1349, (1993); Brockerhoff M., Child survival in big cities: The disadvantage of migrants, Social Science and Medicine, 40, 10, pp. 1371-1383, (1995); The Urban Poor in Bangladesh, Comprehensive Summary Report, (1990); Cox D.R., Regression models and life tables, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 34, pp. 187-220, (1972); Davis K., Cities and mortality, International Population Conference Liege 1973, 3, pp. 259-282, (1973); DaVanzo J., Infant mortality and socioeconomic development: Evidence from Malaysian household data, Demography, 25, 4, pp. 581-595, (1988); Filmer D., Pritchett L., The effect of household wealth on educational attainment: Evidence from 35 countries, Population and Development Review, 25, 1, pp. 85-120, (1999); Harpham T., Lusty T., Vaughan P., In the Shadow of the City, Community Health and the Urban for Poor, (1988); Harpham T., Stephens C., Urbanization and health in developing countries, World Health Statistics Quarterly, 44, 2, pp. 62-69, (1991); Hobcraft J., John N., McDonald W., Rutstein S.O., Socio-economic factors in infant and child mortality: A cross-national comparison, Population Studies, 38, 2, pp. 93-224, (1984); Mojumder P., Mahmud S., Afsar R., Squatter Life in the Agargaon Area, (1989); Mosley W.H., Becker S., Demographic models for child survival and implications for health intervention program, Health Policy and Planning, 6, 3, pp. 218-233, (1991); Tam L., Rural-to-Urban Migration in Bolivia and Peru: Association with Child Mortality, Breastfeeding Cessation, Maternal Care and Contraception, 8, pp. 1-36, (1994); Timaeus I.M., Lush L., Intra-urban differentials in child health, Health Transition Review, 5, 2, pp. 163-190, (1995); Urbanization and Socio-economic Development in Asia and the Pacific, Asian Population Studies Series, 122, (1993); World Population Prospects: The 1998 Revision, Comparative Tables, 1, (1999); Road Map Towards the Implementation of the United Nations Millennium Declaration, (2001); World Urbanization Prospects 2001, (2001); Wagstaff A., Watanabe N., What Difference does the Choice of SES Make in Health Inequality Measurement, (2002); Toward an Urban Strategy for Bangladesh, (1999); Urbanization and health in developing countries: A challenge for health for all, World Health Statistics Quarterly, 44, 4, pp. 185-244, (1991); Zulkifli S.N., Maw Khin U., Yusof K., Lin W.Y., Maternal and child health in urban Sabah, Malysia: A comparison of citizens and migrants, Asia Pacific Journal of Public Health, 7, 3, pp. 151-158, (1994)","","","","","","","","","14697599","","JBSLA","17640395","English","J.

This indirect method of estimation collects data by means of four questions about the death of adult sisters: 1) How many sisters have your ever had (born to the same mother) who ever reached age 15 years? 2) How many of these adult sisters are alive now? 3) How many of these adult sisters are dead? and 4) How many of these dead sisters died during pregnancy, childbirth, or during the six weeks after the end of pregnancy? Information is needed on the five-year age group of the respondent. These questions can be inserted in any survey instrument among all adults in the survey sample. Direct interviews are recommended. Multiple reporting among siblings is not considered to be a problem. The first test of the method was in The Gambia in 1987. Results estimated maternal mortality as 1005 per 100,000 live births. This figure is comparable to figures of 1050 and 950 from other sources. The World Health Organization Factbook on Maternal Mortality cites the sisterhood method as the source for its published estimates. The internal consistency of the data is dependent on the quality of fieldwork and reinterviews of a subsample of respondents concurrently with the survey administration. The sisterhood method is beneficial in the ease of adding four more questions to an existing survey instrument, the small sample size requirements (5500 two-person households), the simplicity of calculations, the opportunity for more detailed community follow-up, and the option of using an opportunistic sample. A community-based sample is best, but the method was successfully used in Nicaragua among a population attending government health facilities.

To assure the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, China will establish a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region allowing the socialist system and the policies practiced in Hong Kong to co-exist under the principle of ""one country, two systems"" as elaborated by the Chinese Government in the Sino-British joint declaration. Under the laws of China, the following Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China is enacted, prescribing the systems to be practiced in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, necessary in order to assure implementation of the policies of China toward Hong Kong. The law covers: 1) General Principles, allowing the previous capitalist system to remain unchanged for 50 years, etc. 2) It establishes the relationship between the Central Authorities and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; e.g., China will defend Hong Kong, Hong Kong will possess independent judicial power. Chapter 3 defines the fundamental rights and duties of Hong Kong residents, and defines in chapter 4) the political structure that includes the Chief Executive, the Executive Authorities, the Legislature, the Judiciary, the District Organizations, and Public Servants. Chapter 5 contains information about the economy, public finance, monetary affairs, trade, industry, commerce, land leases, shipping, and civil aviation. Chapter 6 deals with education, science, culture, sports, religion, and labor and social services. Chapter 7 defines the responsibilities for external affairs. Chapter 8 specifies the interpretation and amendment of the Basic Law, ending with chapter 9 Supplementary Provisions, selection of the Chief Executive, formation of the Legislative Council, voting procedures, and the national laws to be applied in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.","","Asia; Automatic Data Processing; China; Demography; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Far East; Government; Government Publications; Hong Kong; Legislation; Licensure; Political Systems; Politics; Population; Population Dynamics; Records; Socialism; Transients and Migrants; Asia; Capitalism; China; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Government; Government Publication; Hong Kong; Information; Information Processing; Laws And Statutes; Legislation; Migrants; Migration; Permits; Personal Identification Systems; Political Factors; Political Systems; Population; Population Dynamics; Records; Socialism; Travel Documents; article; Asia; China; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Eastern Asia; Far East; government; Government Publication; Hong Kong; information; information processing; law; Laws And Statutes; licensing; Migrants; migration; Permits; Personal Identification Systems; Political Factors; political system; politics; population; population dynamics; Travel Documents","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0892015X","","","12317791","English","Dly Rep China","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025703653"

Young women in the Dominican Republic are the most likely to have had a child by each year of age from 14 through 24, followed by young women on the Island of Puerto Rico; the probability of an early birth is lowest for Puerto Rican women on the U.S. mainland. Eighteen percent of Dominican women have had a child before their 18th birthday compared with 13% of women living in Puerto Rico, and 10% of Puerto Rican women in metropolitan New York. The cumulative probabilities that Puerto Rican women will have borne a child before their 20th birthday are almost identical, whether the women live on the island or the U.S. mainland, but the difference between Puerto Rican and Dominican women widens. The order is reversed, however, in the analysis of premarital births: The probability of a premarital birth during adolescence is highest for Puerto Rican women in New York, and lowest for Dominican women. In a separate logistic regression analysis, education and age at first sexual intercourse are shown to be important determinants of adolescent fertility in all three population; Researchers analyzed 1980s data on female adolescents including Puerto Ricans in the New York metropolitan area, those in Puerto Rico, and Dominicans in the Dominican Republic to determine the probabilities and determinants of adolescent births among these women. Female adolescents from the Dominican Republic had the highest probability of having delivered an infant by each year from 14-24 years followed by those in Puerto Rico and then Puerto Rican immigrants in the US. For example, the cumulative hazard rate at age 24 was .65 for the Dominicans compared to 0.5 for Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico and in the US. Moreover 18% of Dominicans delivered an infant before 18 years old whereas this figure for the 2 Puerto Rican groups was 13% and 10% respectively. Further the cumulative probabilities that Puerto Rican female adolescents will have had a child before 20 years old were essentially equal (37.4% and 37.3% respectively) compared to 56.1% for the Dominicans. On the other hand, the order was opposite for premarital births. Puerto Rican women living in metropolitan New York were at greatest risk of having a premarital birth (cumulative hazard rate at age 24=.2) then those living in Puerto Rico (.1) followed by Dominican women (.05). Age at 1st intercourse was the strongest determinant of adolescent birth in all 3 countries (p=.001). Indeed the younger the adolescent was at 1st intercourse, the greater the likelihood she would deliver a child while an adolescent. Another strong determinant of adolescent birth was dropping out of school (p=.001 in US and Puerto Rico; p=.01 in the Dominican Republic). The fact that most women did not use contraceptives before 1st birth was only significant for the women not living in the US (p=.001). Further research is needed to identify regional and cohort differences in contraceptive use and attitudes toward early sexual activity and childbearing.","","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Adult; Age Factors; Comparative Study; Contraceptive Devices; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Demography; Dominican Republic; Female; Fertility; Hispanic Americans; Human; Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Marriage; Middle Age; Pregnancy; Puerto Rico; Sex Behavior; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; United States; Adolescent Pregnancy; Adolescents; Adolescents, Female; Age Factors; Americas; Behavior; Caribbean; Comparative Studies; Cross-cultural Comparisons; Cultural Background; Data Analysis; Delivery; Demographic Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Dominican Republic; Economic Factors; Educational Status; Ethnic Groups; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; Fertility Surveys; First Intercourse; Hispanics--women; Illegitimacy; International Migration; Latin America; Life Table Method; Migrants; Migration; New Jersey; New York; North America; Northern America; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Premarital Sex Behavior; Puerto Rico; Reproduction; Reproductive Behavior; Research Methodology; Sex Behavior; Social Problems; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Statistical Regression; Studies; United States; Youth--women; adolescent; article; dominican republic; ethnic group; family planning; female; fertility; health education; human; normal human; puerto rico; united states","","","","","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (P30HD028263)","","","","","","","","","","","00147354","","FPGPA","1628712","English","FAM.

Methodology: Data analysis, literature review and policy analysis. Results: NHS nurse staffing growth was approximately 25% over the period 1997-2007, with most growth occurring in the years between 1999 and 2005. Whilst increases in intakes to home-based pre-registration education was a factor in achieving growth, the pace and level of growth which occurred was only possible by using active international recruitment, which was adopted as a deliberate national policy. The numbers of nurses and midwives entering the UK from other countries increased rapidly from 1999 onwards, to a peak in 2002, and then reduced markedly in the period from 2005 onwards. The policy of supporting international recruitment shifted rapidly in late 2005/2006 when financial difficulties hit the NHS and staffing growth was curtailed. Discussion: Active international recruitment can contribute to health sector staffing growth, assuming the recruiting country has the resources to recruit and can tap into international markets, but it may not be effective in addressing all types of skills shortages. If it is not well linked to other components of workforce planning it may cause difficulties of over expansion, as well as raising broader issues of the ethics and impact. © 2009 Royal College of Nursing, Australia.","","Accreditation; Emigration and Immigration; Foreign Professional Personnel; Great Britain; Health Planning; Health Policy; Humans; Licensure, Nursing; Marketing; Nursing Staff; Personnel Selection; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; State Medicine; Training Support; accreditation; article; education; foreign worker; health care planning; health care policy; human; licensing; marketing; migration; national health service; nursing staff; organization and management; personnel management; United Kingdom","","","","","","","Buchan J., International recruitment of nurses: Policy and practice in the United Kingdom, Health Services Research, 42, 3, pp. 1321-1335, (2007); Buchan J., McPake B., Rae G., Mensah K., The Impact of the Department of Health, England Code of Practice on International Recruitment, (2007); Buchan J., Seccombe I., Past trends future imperfect?: A review of the UK nursing Labour Market in 2004/5, (2005); Buchan J., Seccombe I., From boom to bust, (2006); Buchan J., Seccombe I., An incomplete plan, (2008); Department of Health, Guidance on international recruitment, (1999); Department of Health, The NHS plan: A plan for investment, a plan for reform, (2000); Department of Health, Improving working lives standards, (2000); Department of Health, Code of practice for NHS employers involved in International recruitment of healthcare professionals, (2001); Department of Health, More staff working differently, (2002); Department of Health, Agenda for change, final agreements, (2004); Department of Health, Code of practice for the international recruitment of healthcare professionals, (2004); House of Commons, Fourth report: Workforce planning, 22 March 2007 HC, pp. 171-171, (2007); Jackman C., Inside Kevin O7, (2008); O'Dowd A., Return to practice ad sparks 2000 calls, Nursing Times, 100, 33, (2004); Workforce survey results for nursing staff, midwives and health visitors, (2000); World Health Organisation, Working together for health: World Health Report 2006, (2006)","J.

Some geographical variables are analysed due to their importance for spatial distribution, and a historical and economic synthesis is provided so as to help understanding the spatial distribution and the dynamics of the process. The incorporation of the society of Mozambique in the world capitalist economy has meant a demographic transformation together with migratory flows towards regions open to the economy of monetary exchange. The low average density of the population, however, is a result of the differences between the many regions of the country. In 1980, a large part of the territory was uninhabited, while less than 1/4 of the territory concentrated around 40% of the population. These aspects become highly relevant in so far as they may contribute to explain the low population of the country and the tendencies of the phenomenon of urbanization and of respective process of population concentration. Studies of internal migration, not adequate at the present moment due to the war, must be carried out to clarify this process of urbanization and economic concentration. -from Authors","","Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Africa, Eastern; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Geography; Mozambique; Population; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Research; Research Design; Statistics; Mozambique; Africa; Africa South Of The Sahara; Data Analysis; Data Quality; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Eastern Africa; Economic Development; Economic Factors; Geographic Factors; Mozambique; Population; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Portuguese Speaking Africa; Research Methodology; Spatial Distribution; spatial distribution; demographic change; demographic transformation; developing country; economic concentration; migration; migration flow; population concentration; population distribution; spatial pattern; urbanisation; Africa; Africa south of the Sahara; article; data analysis; Data Quality; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Eastern Africa; economic development; Economic Factors; economics; Geographic Factors; geography; methodology; Mozambique; population; population density; population dynamics; Portuguese Speaking Africa; research; Research Methodology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12318052","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025576233"

The survey considered as unemployed not only individuals who sought work in the week preceding the survey, but also those available and willing to work for pay who hadn't actually looked for a job. The broadened definition of unemployment was intended to take into account discouraged job seekers. The economic activity rate and unemployment rate respectively were 67.9 and 26.2% for both sexes, 80.9 and 11.8% for men, and 55.2 and 46.7% for women at the national level; 68.8 and 27.4% for both sexes, 78.9 and 13.6% for men, and 60.0 and 43.0% for women in urban areas; and 66.5 and 24.2% for both sexes, 83.6% and 9.5% for men, and 46.6 and 54.9% for women in rural areas. the inclusion of discouraged job seekers in the definition of unemployment resulted in a higher proportion of women than shown in previous surveys. But the lower rate for men compared to previous surveys suggests that open unemployment for men has declined in recent years. The lower unemployment rate for men may reflect the increasing numbers who have sought self-employment in marginal activities in the tertiary sector in response to the country's grave economic crisis. 50.1% of all persons aged 10 or over carried out some productive work in the reference week. Persons disposed to work who did not seek work comprised 23.4% of the labor force, amounting to 45.1% of women and 8.2% of men. 41% of the unemployed had been disposed to work for more than one year. 25% of the labor force was employed in agriculture and 31.5% in services. 36% of males were in agriculture, while over 50% of women were in services. 46.1% of men and 67.0% of women worked for wages or salaries, 38.3% of men and 24.1% of women were self-employed, and 10.6% of men and 6.2% of women were unpaid family workers. At the time of the 1991 survey, 34.3% of the native-born population resided in a place different from that of birth. The proportion of migrants was about 40% in urban areas and 26% in rural areas. 57% of internal migrants were born in urban areas. 9.9% of females and 7.4% of males over age 5 lived in a different locale than their residence of five years earlier. 59.4% had lived in an urban area, 35.0% in a rural area, and 1.6% in a different country. 55.2% of internal migrants were female. 46.0% of internal migrants and 40.3% of the general population was aged 15-64 years. 37.8% of migrants and 49.9% of nonmigrants were under 15. Economic activity rates for the population over age 10 were 65.8% for nonmigrants and 70.5% for migrants, while unemployment rates were 28.5% for nonmigrants and 23.9% for migrants. 16.7% of households surveyed in the Expanded Household Questionnaire had members who lived or had lived abroad.","","Age Factors; Americas; Caribbean Region; Demography; Developing Countries; Dominican Republic; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; English Abstract; Health Manpower; Latin America; North America; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Residential Mobility; Rural Population; Sex Factors; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Unemployment; Urban Population; Age Factors; Americas; Caribbean; Demographic And Health Surveys; Demographic Factors; Demographic Surveys; Developing Countries; Dominican Republic; Economic Factors; Employment; Employment Status; Human Resources; International Migration; Labor Force; Latin America; Macroeconomic Factors; Migration; Migration, Internal; North America; Occupational Status; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Rural Population; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Unemployment; Urban Population; age; article; Central America; Demographic And Health Surveys; Demographic Factors; Demographic Surveys; demography; developing country; Dominican Republic; Economic Factors; economics; employment; Employment Status; health care manpower; Human Resources; International Migration; Labor Force; Macroeconomic Factors; migration; Migration, Internal; North America; Occupational Status; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; rural population; sex difference; social class; social status; socioeconomics; South and Central America; unemployment; urban population; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12178314","Spanish","Poblac Desarro","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027011103"

The most recent estimates place China's overseas population at 22.1 million, 19 million (88%) of which are concentrated in Southeast Asia. According to the author's calculations, at least 7 million of the Chinese overseas population are of Fujian descent. Indonesia alone holds some 3.3 million Fujianese. Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines account for most of the remaining Fujianese overseas population. Having established the extent of international migration from the Fujian Province, the author attempts to establish the reasons behind it. The author first considers the historical origins of Fujianese international migration, from its early states (end century B.C.-17th century) to modern times *18-early 20th century) to the current period (1949-present). The author then examines the reasons behind the migration, primarily the social environment and individual behavior. Finally, the author provides categories of international migration, stressing that these categories often overlap or coincide. Most of the early migration was ""spontaneous"" -- essentially, an unplanned occurrence. During the modern period, most migration was ""forced"" by the contract labor system instituted by colonialists. Political and social upheaval also prompted ""provoked"" international migration. And following the Chinese Revolution, ""free"" migration allowed many to return home or to join relative abroad.","","Asia; Behavior; China; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Environment; Far East; Geography; Personality; Politics; Population; Population Dynamics; Psychology; Research; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Administrative Districts; Asia; Behavior; China; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Destination; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; Environment; Geographic Factors; International Migration--history; Migration; Personality; Political Factors; Population; Population Dynamics; Psychological Factors; Research Methodology; Socioeconomic Factors; Administrative Districts; article; Asia; behavior; China; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; Destination; developing country; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; economics; environment; Far East; Geographic Factors; geography; International Migration--history; migration; personality; Political Factors; politics; population; population dynamics; Psychological Factors; psychology; research; Research Methodology; socioeconomics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10448403","","","12284987","English","Chin J Popul Sci","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025526575"

The information to be entered includes surname, forename, patronymic, address, citizenship, year of birth, family status, education, profession, place of work, and military obligation. Each person will receive a personal code number to be recorded on passports, birth certificates, state social insurance cards, driver's licenses, and other documents. The Law was enacted, in part, so that passports that are to be issued starting in February 1992, could contain the code number. All citizens of Lithuania are to be issued passports by 1 July 1993. On 8 January 1992, the Government of Lithuania adopted Resolution No. 7 on supplementing and partially amending Lithuanian Government Resolution No. 314 of 31 July 1991 on state excise duties.

This falciparum upsurge was accompanied by a significant rise in the number of vivax cases that helped bring the annual parasite index to figures ranging from 260 positive smears per 1,000 inhabitants in 1986 to 973 in 1988 and 776 in 1991. The chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strain responsible apparently travelled from the area of the Rupununi River in Southern Guyana to the more northern Cuyuni/Mazaruni/Potaro area in 1985, and from there was brought into the North West Region, probably by itinerant miners. Circumstances leading to the present endemic demonstrate how transient populations, resistant parasites, and economic restraints can interfere with malaria control, and how rapidly high malaria prevalences can establish themselves in receptive tropical areas vulnerable to attack.; Falciparum malaria was absent from North West Guyana for more than two decades, but returned in 1986 to rapidly affect a large share of the region's inhabitants. This increase in the prevalence of falciparum was accompanied by a significant rise in the number of vivax cases which helped push the annual parasite index range from 260 positive smears per 1000 inhabitants in 1986 to 973 in 1988 and 776 in 1991. The author reviews the demographics and economic development conditions of North West Guyana from 1945 to 1992 to document the reappearance of falciparum malaria after an absence of 24 years. It seems as though the chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strain responsible travelled from the area of the Rupununi River in southern Guyana to the more northern Cuyuni/Mazaruni/Potaro area in 1985, from where it was most likely brought into the North West Region by itinerant miners. It is pointed out how a combination of transient populations, resistant parasites, and economic constraints can interfere with malaria control, and how rapidly high malaria prevalences can establish themselves in receptive tropical areas vulnerable to attack.","","Adolescent; Adult; Animal; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Outbreaks; Drug Resistance; Female; Guyana; Human; Infant; Malaria, Falciparum; Malaria, Vivax; Male; Mining; Plasmodium falciparum; Prevalence; Americas; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Diseases; Economic Conditions; Economic Factors; Guyana; Health; Historical Survey; Macroeconomic Factors; Malaria--history; Malaria--prevention and control; Migrants; Migration; Parasite Control; Parasitic Diseases; Population; Population Dynamics; Public Health; South America; adolescent; adult; animal; article; child; data analysis; Demographic Factors; developing country; disease transmission; Diseases; drug effect; drug resistance; Economic Conditions; Economic Factors; epidemic; female; Guyana; health; Historical Survey; human; infant; Macroeconomic Factors; malaria; malaria falciparum; Malaria--history; Malaria--prevention and control; male; Migrants; migration; mining; parasite control; parasitosis; Plasmodium falciparum; population; population dynamics; preschool child; prevalence; public health; South America; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00854638","","","7951362","English","Bull Pan Am Health Organ","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028503047"

The population growth rate has increased to 2.66% during 1971-81 due to declines in mortality. Growth has been uneven by region. These conditions prompted the interest in analyzing the patterns of population growth by levels of agricultural development for the 75 districts of Nepal for 1971-81. Factor analysis was used to obtain the ranking of agricultural development for each region and to analyze regional differences. Indirect demographic measures were used to estimate the rate of increase of the population, crude death rate (CDR), crude birth rate, rate of natural increase, and rate of net migration. The hypotheses assumed cause and effect between agricultural development and population growth and reciprocal causation. Agricultural development affects fertility in an uncertain and indirect way. Agricultural development is likely to increase food availability, which in turn reduces malnutrition and declines in infant mortality. Agricultural development and mortality levels are inversely related. The nature of the relationship between agricultural development and the rate of natural increase is uncertain; observed differentials may be insignificant in the early stages of development. Agricultural development leads to an increase in demand for labor. Agricultural development and population growth are positively related. There were 12 measures of agricultural development used to obtain factor scores. The results show 69% of the variance is explained by three factors of agricultural development. Factors 1 and 2 were used to classify districts into 3 levels of development. Higher agricultural development is related to clear declines in the CDR and an increasing rate of natural increase. Net in-migration is positively related to agricultural development, i.e., high agricultural development is associated with a high rate of total increase. Population density follows a similar pattern. 17 out of 18 districts in Terai region are in the high agricultural development stage. 50% of districts in hill and mountain regions are in the low grouping. Correlation coefficients confirm findings about the relationship between population growth and agricultural development.","","Agriculture; Asia; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Geography; Mortality; Nepal; Population; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Research; Residential Mobility; Social Planning; Statistics; Agricultural Development; Asia; Data Analysis; Death Rate; Demographic Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Factor Analysis; Geographic Factors; Interdisciplinary Studies; Migration; Migration, Internal; Mortality; Multiregional Analysis; Natural Increase; Nepal; Population; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Population Growth--changes; Research Methodology; Rural Development; Southern Asia; Spatial Distribution; spatial distribution; Agricultural Development; agriculture; article; Asia; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Economic Factors; economics; factorial analysis; Geographic Factors; geography; Interdisciplinary Studies; migration; Migration, Internal; mortality; Multiregional Analysis; Natural Increase; Nepal; policy; population; population density; population dynamics; population growth; Population Growth--changes; research; Research Methodology; Rural Development; Southern Asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12344931","English","Econ J Nepal","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025413050"

It focuses on Mainland Chinese (MLC) immigrants - the most important source of immigrants to Canada since 1996 - in the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), Canada. Specifically, the paper aims to explore the choice between Chinese-speaking and non-Chinese-speaking family physicians by MLC immigrants and to determine the underlying reasons for MLC immigrants use of ethnically- and linguistically-matched family physicians. A wide range of data are analyzed including survey and focus group data, physician data from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) and geo-referenced 2001 Canadian Census data. A mixed-method approach is employed combining quantitative analysis of survey data and Census data, spatial analysis of patient travel behaviour based on the survey and qualitative analysis based on focus groups. The paper reveals an overwhelming preference among MLC survey respondents for Chinese-speaking family physicians regardless of study areas and socioeconomic and demographic status. The focus groups suggest that language, culture and ethnicity are intertwined in a complex way to influence the choice of health care providers and health management strategies in the host society. The paper yields important policy implications for identifying health professional shortage areas for culturally-diverse populations, addressing issues related to foreign-trained physicians and enhancing primary care delivery relevant for immigrant populations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this is where the near consensus on human settlement history ends, and considerable uncertainty clouds any more detailed aspect of human colonization history. Here, we present a dynamic genetic model of human settlement history coupled with explicit geographical distances from East Africa, the likely origin of modern humans. We search for the best-supported parameter space by fitting our analytical prediction to genetic data that are based on 52 human populations analyzed at 783 autosomal microsatellite markers. This framework allows us to jointly estimate the key parameters of the expansion of modern humans. Our best estimates suggest an initial expansion of modern humans ∼56,000 years ago from a small founding population of ∼1,000 effective individuals. Our model further points to high growth rates in newly colonized habitats. The general fit of the model with the data is excellent. This suggests that coupling analytical genetic models with explicit demography and geography provides a powerful tool for making inferences on human-settlement history. © 2006 by The American Society of Human Genetics.

Chinese research follows in the traditions of Western ecological and social spatial theories of urban population distribution. Xu Wei and Yu Wei discovered that Shanghai's social space was affected by population clustering and the structure of population culture and occupation. Xu Xueqiang analyzed the social space structure of Guangzhou City using 67 variables. Data for this analysis were obtained from the neighborhood census area for 1982 and 1990 in Shanghai. Land utility data pertained to 1988. The geological information system techniques of Zhu Junming were used to establish the 119 spatial units. Urban social space structure is characterized by 14 factors generated from 113 variables: degree of population density, household registration structure, natural and mechanical changes of population, zoning, sex, age, education, employment, occupation, marital status, land utility, residential conditions, and housing typology. Principal components factor analysis, which was based on the principal components factor score matrix, and systematic cluster analysis were used to categorize spatial units and assign typologies. Ward statistics for distance coefficients were used to determine appropriate categorization. Findings indicate that 69.4% of the total variance in spatial units could be characterized by six principal components: educational structure (26.1%), degree of population density (17.11%), gender and occupational structure (11.3%), immigrant population (6.1%), living conditions (5.23%), and marital status (3.5%). Five social region typologies were constructed: a high density commercial residential area, a medium density cultural residential area, an industrial mixed residential area, newly erected residential areas, and outlying science and technology, cultural, and educational areas. The Shanghai social space structure was affected by history, urban planning, and housing assignment to become a multicenter city.","","Asia; China; Data Collection; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Educational Status; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Far East; Geography; Housing; Marital Status; Marriage; Models, Theoretical; Multivariate Analysis; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Research; Residence Characteristics; Sampling Studies; Sex Factors; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; Urban Population; Asia; China; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; Educational Status; Employment Status; Geographic Factors; Housing; Immigrants; Marital Status; Migrants; Migration; Models, Theoretical; Multivariate Analysis; Nuptiality; Occupational Status; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Research Report; Residence Characteristics; Sampling Studies; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Spatial Distribution; Studies; Surveys; Urban Population; article; Asia; China; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; economics; educational status; employment; employment status; epidemiology; Far East; Geographic Factors; geography; housing; Immigrants; information processing; marriage; methodology; Migrants; migration; multivariate analysis; nuptiality; Occupational Status; population; population and population related phenomena; population density; population dynamics; research; Research Report; sex difference; social class; social status; socioeconomics; spatial distribution; statistics; Studies; Surveys; theoretical model; urban population","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10448403","","","12291457","English","Chin J Popul Sci","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029693136"

Current and future challenges, both in computational methodology and in analytical theory, are to develop models and techniques to extract the most information possible from multilocus DNA datasets. As an example of the theoretical issues, five limiting forms of the island model of population subdivision with migration are presented in a unified framework. These approximations illustrate the interplay between migration and drift in structuring gene genealogies, and some of them mike connections between the fairly complicated island-model genealogical process and the much simpler, unstructured neutral coalescent process which underlies most inferential techniques in population genetics.","","Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Drift; Genetics, Population; Models, Genetic; Population Dynamics; analytic method; conference paper; data analysis; DNA determination; gene structure; genealogy; genetic model; history; human; mathematical analysis; nonhuman; population genetics; population model; priority journal; theoretical model; theory","","","","","National Science Foundation","From the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University, 2102 Biological Laboratories, 16 Divinity Ave., Cambridge, MA 02138.

Determining the cause of an observed decline is important in understanding the epidemiology of HIV. Objective: To explore how patterns of recruitment and interactions between subpopulations in different areas influence the predicted decline in the prevalence of HIV in the absence of reductions in risk behaviour. Methods: A deterministic mathematical model of the heterosexual transmission of HIV in high prevalence endemic settings incorporating various patterns of recruitment to high-risk behaviour groups, population growth and migration was solved numerically. The possibility that apparent trends are generated or obscured through aggregating data from across areas experiencing different epidemics is also considered. Results: Declines in the prevalence of HIV can occur even if individuals do not change behaviour, raising the possibility that epidemic downturns could be wrongly attributed to interventions. This effect is greatest when individuals do not enter higher risk groups to compensate for reductions in size caused by deaths from AIDS and when migration is non-random with respect to risk or infectious status and migration patterns change as the epidemic matures. In contrast, aggregating prevalence data from subregions with different epidemic profiles tends to mask declines in prevalence. Conclusions: Interpreting surveillance data is important in understanding widespread responses to HIV epidemics. The results show that understanding patterns of adoption of risk behaviours and patterns of migration is important in interpreting declines in the prevalence of HIV.","","Emigration and Immigration; HIV Infections; Humans; Prevalence; Sexual Partners; Unsafe Sex; article; data analysis; epidemic; high risk behavior; high risk population; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence; mathematical model; migration; population dynamics; population growth; priority journal; trend study","","","","","","","AIDS epidemic update, (2007); Susser M., Some principles in study design for preventing HIV transmission: Rigor or reality, Am J Public Health, 86, pp. 1713-1716, (1996); Hallett T., Garnett G., Mupamberiyi Z., Et al., Measuring effectiveness in community randomized trials of HIV prevention, Int J Epidemiol, 37, pp. 77-87, (2008); Anderson R.M., May R.M., Infectious diseases of humans, (1991); Garnett G.P., The geographical and temporal evolution of sexually transmitted disease epidemics, Sex Transm Infect, 78, SUPPL. 1, (2002); Hallett T.B., White P.J., Garnett G.P., Appropriate evaluation of HIV prevention interventions: From experiment to full-scale implementation, Sex Transm Infect, 83, SUPPL. 1, (2007); UNAIDS, Trends in HIV incidence and prevalence: Natural course of the epidemic or results of behavioural change?

A random systematic sample of 398 files that had complete information was selected from the total of 10,451 files in three sample centers during the period January to June 1989. The dependent variable, crowding inside home, was measured by the average number of persons per room in the house. The dummy regression technique was employed for data analysis. For husband's occupation, the reference category was low status occupation; for both husband's and wife's education, the reference category was less than elementary (low level) education. Of the total sample of 398 families, 205 were Saudi families, while the remaining 193 were foreign non-Saudi families. 82% of the Saudis and 85% of the non-Saudis averaged between 1 to 3 persons per room, although 32.7% and 22.3%, respectively, had an average of 2 to 3 persons per room, perhaps because the number of living children of Saudis was 5.03 compared to 2.65 of non-Saudis. 64% of the Saudi husbands were engaged in high status occupations compared to 73% of their non-Saudi counterparts. For both Saudis and non-Saudis, the greater the number of living children, the greater was the number of persons per room: an increase of 1 child in the family was associated with increases of 0.11 and 0.22 persons per room for Saudis and non-Saudis, respectively. Also for Saudi families, where husbands had high status occupations, the average number of persons per room was significantly fewer (by approximately 0.2 persons) than for families where husbands had low status occupations, while for non-Saudi families the relationship between husband's occupation and the number of persons per room was insignificant.","","Asia; Asia, Western; Comparative Study; Crowding; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Ethnic Groups; Family Characteristics; Geography; Middle East; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Regression Analysis; Research; Saudi Arabia; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; Arab Countries; Asia; Comparative Studies; Crowding; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Employment Status; Family And Household; Family Characteristics; Family Size; Geographic Factors; Immigrants; Migrants; Migration; Nationality; Native-born; Occupational Status; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Saudi Arabia; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Spatial Distribution; Statistical Regression; Studies; Western Asia; spatial distribution; Arab Countries; article; Asia; Comparative Studies; comparative study; crowding; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Economic Factors; economics; employment; Employment Status; ethnic group; Family And Household; family size; Geographic Factors; geography; Immigrants; Middle East; Migrants; migration; Nationality; Native-born; Occupational Status; population; population and population related phenomena; population density; population dynamics; regression analysis; research; Research Methodology; Saudi Arabia; social class; social status; socioeconomics; Statistical Regression; Studies; Western Asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12289947","English","Nufusbil Derg","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028715855"

Box 812, Cameroon","In this paper, we present a deterministic time discrete mathematical model based on multiregional periodic matrices to describe the dynamics of Sardina pilchardus in the Central Atlantic area of the Moroccan coast. This model deals with two stages (immature and mature) and three spatial zones where sardines are supposed to migrate from one zone to another. The population dynamics is described by an autonomous recurrence equation N(t + 1) = A.N(t), where A is a positive matrix whose entries are estimated using data collected during biannual acoustic surveys carried out from 2001 to 2003 onboard the Norwegian research vessel ""Dr Fridtjof Nansen"". The dominant eigenvalue λ of A that gives the long-term growth rate of fish population is smaller than one. This agrees with the stock decrease observed in the data collected. We show that λ is highly sensitive to the recruitment rate and much less sensitive to the reproduction rate. These results can clearly be used to define an efficient scenario in order to fight for instance against a stock decrease. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Dominant eigenvalue; Fisheries management; Growth rate; Mathematical model; Multiregional periodic matrices; Sardina pilchardus; Sensitivity; Sub-stage","Animal Migration; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Fisheries; Fishes; Models, Biological; Morocco; Population Dynamics; Atlantic Coast [Morocco]; Atlantic Coast [North Africa]; Morocco; Clupeidae; Sardina pilchardus; acoustic survey; bioacoustics; clupeoid fishery; data processing; eigenvalue; fighting; fishery management; growth rate; numerical model; population dynamics; recurrence interval; reproduction; research vessel; sensitivity analysis; spatial analysis; stock assessment; animal; article; Atlantic Ocean; biological model; fish; food industry; growth, development and aging; methodology; Morocco; population dynamics; population migration","","","","","","","Amenzoui K., Ferhan-Tachinante F., Yahyaoui A., Kifani S., Mesfioui A., Analysis of the cycle of reproduction of Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum, 1792) off the Moroccan Atlantic coast, C R Biol, 329, pp. 892-901, (2006); Belveze H., Biologie et dynamique des populations de sardine, Sardina Pilchardus (W), (1984); Beverton R.J.H., Holt S.J., On the dynamics of exploited fish populations, Fish Invest Minist Agric Fish Food G B (2 Sea Fish), 2, (1957); Caswell H., Matrix Population Models, pp. 206-211, (2001); Caswell H., Trevisan M.C., The sensitivity analysis of periodic matrix models, Ecol Modell, 75, pp. 1299-1303, (1994); Chlaida M., Kifani S., Lenfant P., Ouragh L., First approach for the identification of sardine populations Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum 1792) in the Moroccan Atlantic by allozymes, Marine Biol, 149, pp. 169-175, (2006); Efron B., Tibshirani R.J., An Introduction to the Bootstrap, (1993); Ettahiri O., Etude de la phase planctonique de la sardine, Sardina pilchardus (Walb.), et de l'Anchois, Engraulis encrasicolus (L.) des Côtes Atlantiques Marocaines, (1996); Rapport de la troisième réunion du groupe de travail ad hoc sur la sardine (Sardina pilchardus Walb.), (1985); Rapport des groupes de travail ad hoc sur la sardine et sur les chinchards et les maquereaux dans la région nord du COPACE, (1990); Working Group On The Assessment of Small Pelagic Fish of Small Palagic Fish Off Northest Africa, (2008); Foote K.G., Fish target strengths for use in echo integration survey, J Acoust Soc Am, 82, 3, pp. 981-987, (1987); Maclennan D.N., Simmonds E.J., Fisheries Acoustics.

Despite these roles, relatively little is known about the age, growth, and demographics of field populations. To begin to address these issues, we systematically sampled urchins during 1997 and 1998 at two sites (Allen Island [AI] and Schoodic Peninsula [SP]) in the Gulf of Maine, USA. Basic demographic information (density and size structure) was obtained and a subset of urchins aged by counting annual bands on the interambulacral plates. Size-at-age analyses showed that the population at AI consisted of two sympatric growth morphs, fast growing (fg) and slow growing (sg), each described by its own von Bertalanffy growth parameters for mean size and size variance. The two morphs also differed in maximum observed ages (sg, 6-11 yr, vs. fg, 16-18 yr) and in maximum test diameter sizes (sg, 30-35 mm, vs. fg, 50-70 mm). At SP, a single (fg) morph was identified which had growth characteristics similar to the fg morph at AI. An obviously bimodal size-frequency distribution at AI reflects the accumulation of urchins of each morph at asymptotic size. We advanced several hypotheses, including intrinsic factors (e.g., sex ratios, morphology, and genetics) and extrinsic factors (e.g., density, spatial distribution, settlement history, growth history, and migration) to explain the origin and coexistence of the two growth forms. Using primary and post hoc data analyses, we rejected sex ratio, density, spatial relations, and morphology. Analysis of annual growth and age structure indicated that the two morphs had different settlement histories, suggesting the mixing of two genetically distinct populations. Our post hoc analyses could not reject the genetics or growth history and migration hypotheses. Genetically different larvae, or else a phased process of differential settlement, migration, and growth (threshold migration hypothesis) are the most likely cause(s) for the two morphs. Our data indicate that field growth rates in green urchins are intrinsically highly variable but also vary interannually, probably in relation to their environment. Intrinsic variability provides a novel explanation for bimodality of size-frequency distributions in urchin populations. Interestingly, the sublegal size <50 mm) and short life span of the sg morph preempts its recruitment into the fishery. Moreover, if the sg morph is widespread and genetically based, intensive harvesting may enhance selection for the sg morph. These findings may have serious implications for understanding the population structure and managing the green urchin fishery, and for assessing the grazing impact of these urchins in nearshore communities.","Age validation; Dimorphism; Droebachiensis; Fishery management; Genetic selection; Green sea urchin; Growth model; Growth rate; Growth variability; Maine; Migration; Size frequency; Strongylocentrotus; Sympatric growth morphs","Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Maine; Echinodermata; Echinoidea; Echinoidea; Invertebrata; Lytechinus variegatus; Strongylocentrotus; Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis; Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis; dimorphism; echinoderm; fishery management; genetic variation; growth form; growth rate; population dynamics; size structure","","","","","","","Andrew N.L., Contrasting ecological implications of food limitation in sea urchins and herbivorous gastropods, Marine Ecology Progress Series, 51, pp. 189-193, (1989); Black R., Johnson M.S., Trendall J.T., Relative size of Aristotle's Lantern in Echinometra mathaei occurring at different densities, Marine Biology, 71, pp. 101-106, (1982); Bossart J.L., Prowell D.P., Genetic estimates of population structure and gene flow: Limitations, lessons and new directions, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 13, pp. 202-206, (1998); Botsford L.W., Smith B.D., Quinn J.F., Bimodality in size distributions: The red sea urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus as an example, Ecological Applications, 4, pp. 42-50, (1994); Briscoe C.S., Sebens K.P., Omnivory in Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (Müller) (Echinodermata: Echinoidea): Predation on subtidal mussels, Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 115, pp. 1-24, (1988); Burnham K.P., Anderson D.R., Model selection and inference: A practical information-theoretic approach, (1998); Cook S.A., Johnson M.P., Adaptation to heterogeneous environments.

A standard cohort component method was used to project populations by sex and 5-year age groups for each quinquennium between 1989 and 2019. 3 hypotheses were proposed. In Hypothesis 1, fertility was assumed to stabilize at a level of a TFR of 3.5 children per woman. In Hypothesis 3, fertility was assumed to decline up to the period 1990-2004 and up to the replacement level (2.23 children per woman during that period). Hypothesis 2 represents an intermediate situation between Hypothesis 1 and 3 which was considered as the most plausible future trend of fertility. According to Projection 2 the population of Mongolia will be almost 3.8 million in the year 2019. Projections 1 and 3 give total populations of 4.2 and 3.5 million, respectively. The difference between a TFR of 2.2 and 3.5 for the last quinquennium of the projection period resulted in a difference of around 700,000 people. The difference between Projections 1 and 2 is about 400,000 people. Considering the fertility assumptions adopted for these projections, it is not very likely that the size of the population at the turn of the century will be much smaller than 2.6 million or larger than 3 million. What is more uncertain is the scenario for the 2nd decade of next century. During the next 2 decades, the growth will become gradually more moderate. The main changes will be an increase in the proportion of the population between 15 and 64 years of age, a decline in the proportion of the young population of the young population resulting in a substantial decrease of the dependency ratio and an increase in the median age of the population. According to the 3 hypotheses, the young population will continue growing, albeit at a slower pace. There will be a decline in the proportion of young to old people and an increase in the proportion of the population in the working age groups. Yet, all age groups will continue to increase in absolute terms. International migration may produce some deviations in this expected profile.","","Adolescent; Age Distribution; Age Factors; Asia; Automatic Data Processing; Birth Rate; Cohort Studies; Demography; Dependency (Psychology); Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Far East; Fertility; Forecasting; International Agencies; Mongolia; Organizations; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research; Sex Distribution; Sex Factors; Software; Statistics; United Nations; Age Distribution; Age Factors; Asia; Birth Rate; Cohort Analysis; Computer Programs And Programming; Demographic Factors; Dependency Burden; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; Estimation Technics; Fertility; Fertility Decline; Fertility Measurements; Fertility Rate; Information; Information Processing; International Agencies; International Migration; Microeconomic Factors; Migration; Mongolia; Organizations; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Projection; Research Methodology; Sex Distribution; Sex Factors; Total Fertility Rate; Un; Unfpa; Youth; reproduction rate; adolescent; age; age distribution; article; Asia; birth rate; cohort analysis; computer program; Computer Programs And Programming; Demographic Factors; demography; Dependency Burden; dependent personality disorder; developing country; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; economics; Estimation Technics; Far East; fertility; Fertility Decline; Fertility Measurements; forecasting; information; information processing; international cooperation; International Migration; juvenile; Microeconomic Factors; migration; Mongolia; organization; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; Population Projection; research; Research Methodology; sex difference; sex ratio; Total Fertility Rate; Un; Unfpa; United Nations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0259238X","","","12317941","English","Asia Pac Popul J","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027020308"

Cross-national comparisons of injury mortality can suggest possible causal explanations for injuries across different countries and cultures. This study identifies differences in injury mortality between Los Angeles (LA) County, California and Mexico City DF, Mexico. Methods. Using LA County and Mexico City death certificate data for 1994 and 1995, injury deaths were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification external cause of injury codes. Crude, gender-, and age-adjusted annual fatality rates were calculated and comparisons were made between the two regions. Results. Overall and age-adjusted injury death rates were higher for Mexico City than for LA County. Injury death rates were found to be higher for young adults in LA County and for elderly residents of Mexico City. Death rates for motor vehicle crashes, falls, and undetermined causes were higher in Mexico City, and relatively high rates of poisoning, homicide, and suicide were found for LA County. Motor vehicle crash and fall death rates in Mexico City increased beginning at about age 55, while homicide death rates were dramatically higher among young adults in LA County. The largest proportion of motor vehicle crash deaths was to motor vehicle occupants in LA County and to pedestrians in Mexico City. Conclusions. These findings illustrate the importance of primary injury prevention in countries having underdeveloped trauma care systems and should aid in setting priorities for future work. The high frequency of pedestrian fatalities in Mexico City may be related to migration of rural populations, differing vehicle characteristics and traffic patterns, and lack of safety knowledge. Mexico City's higher rate of fall-related deaths may be due to concurrent morbidity from chronic conditions, high-risk environments, and delay in seeking medical treatment.","External cause; Injury deaths; Mortality; Rates","California; Los Angeles; Mexico; Mexico City; United States; injury; international comparison; mortality; population dynamics; age; article; chronic disease; comparative study; controlled study; cultural anthropology; data analysis; death certificate; falling; female; health care availability; health care planning; human; injury; intoxication; major clinical study; male; Mexico; migration; morbidity; mortality; pedestrian; primary prevention; priority journal; public health; risk assessment; rural population; sex difference; suicide; traffic accident; traffic safety; United States","","","","","","","Rockett I.R.H., Smith G.S., Injuries and the Australian mortality mosaic: A comparison with the United Kingdom and New Zealand, Public Health, 103, pp. 353-361, (1989); Rockett I.R.H., Smith G.S., Homicide, suicide, motor vehicle crash and fall mortality: United States experience in comparative perspective, Am J Public Health, 72, pp. 1396-1400, (1989); Li G., Baker S.P., A comparison of injury death rates in China and the United States, Am J Public Health, 81, pp. 605-609, (1991); Langlois J.A., Smith G.S., Baker S.P., Langley J.D., International comparisons of injury mortality in the elderly: Issues and differences between New Zealand and the United States, Int J Epidemiol, 24, pp. 136-143, (1995); 1, (1994); Fingerhut L.A., Cox C.S., Warner M., (1998); Hijar M., Salud Publica de Mexico, 32, pp. 395-404, (1990); (1998); Jacobs G.D., Sayer I., Road accidents in developing countries, Accid Anal Prev, 15, pp. 337-353, (1983); Kandela P., Road accidents in Jordon (News), Lancet, 1, pp. 342-426, (1993); Downing A., 16, pp. 3-4, (1990); Kraus J., Hooten E.G., Brown K.A., Peek-Asa C., Heye C., McArthur D.L., Child pedestrian and bicyclist injuries: Results of community surveillance and a case-control study, Inj Prev, 2, pp. 212-218, (1996); Malini E., Victor D.J., Measures to improve pedestrian safety; lessons from experience in Madras (Abstract), J Traffic Med, 18, (1990); (1996); Hijar M., Ortega L., Dimas M., Salud Publica de Mexico, 31, pp. 447-468, (1989); Mock C., Jurkovich G., nu-Amon-Kotei D., Arreola-Risa C., Maier R., Trauma mortality patterns in three nations at different economic levels: Implications for global trauma system development, J Trauma, 44, pp. 804-812, (1998); (1998); (1992); JAMA, 259, pp. 2357-2362, (1988)","J.F.

Existing theoretical approaches still seem to be insufficient to account for this fact, even if there is empirical evidence supporting their main hypotheses. The effect of partnership cannot be totally traced back to the effect of variables related to these theories. In explaining the independent influence of partnership on migration behavior a microeconomic model of household decision making serves as a starting point. The model is extended by more explicit assumptions concerning the bargaining process and the problem of decision making under risk and uncertainty. As a consequence costs and risks of bargaining are major obstacles to the willingness to move. Anticipation of these difficulties often leads to a reluctance to set the migration decision on the agenda. The proposed theoretical models are empirically tested using the data of the survey on 'migration potentials', which was conducted at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MCES).","","Behavior; Decision Making; Demography; Developed Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Europe; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Family Characteristics; Geography; Germany; Interpersonal Relations; Marital Status; Marriage; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Dynamics; Psychology; Research; Residence Characteristics; Residential Mobility; Statistics; Behavior; Data Analysis; Decision Making; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Europe; Factor Analysis; Family And Household; Geographic Factors; Germany; Interpersonal Relations; Marital Status; Migration; Models, Theoretical; Nuptiality; Partner Communication; Population; Population Dynamics; Psychological Factors; Research Methodology; Residence Characteristics; Residential Mobility; Spatial Distribution; Western Europe; World; article; behavior; data analysis; decision making; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; Europe; factorial analysis; Family And Household; family size; Geographic Factors; geography; Germany; human relation; marriage; methodology; migration; nuptiality; Partner Communication; population; population dynamics; Psychological Factors; psychology; research; spatial distribution; statistics; theoretical model; Western Europe; World","","","","","","","Abelson R.P., Levi A., Decision Making and Decision Theory, Handbook of Social Psychology.

The issues are basic in nature which have been focused by scholars all over time and again. The materials are gathered from various sources to highlight and to consider a plea in the context of population-hydrological regions of the country to develop water potentials. Some characteristic mapping has also been conducted showing the main parameters of water utilization, need and spatial issues regarding consumptive use of water during agricultural operations as per the seasons prevalent in India. A relation is also established with the drought areas leading to assess the need for water. The human problems specially in relation to the safe drinking water is also projected in relation to distributional qualities with reference to natural regions by districts. The study does not claim a full assessment of the water issue due to paucity of statistics on water use, generation and potentials but it does indicate in many ways the geographical problems as an important study for further research by all concerned. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","","Agriculture; Asia; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Environment; Evaluation Studies; Geography; Health; Health Services Needs and Demand; India; Maps; Natural Disasters; Organization and Administration; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Public Health; Research; Research Design; Residential Mobility; Rural Population; Sanitation; Statistics; Urban Population; Water Supply; India; Agriculture; Asia; Climate; Consumption; Critique; Data Analysis; Data Quality; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Drought; Economic Factors; Environment; Geographic Factors; Health; India; Macroeconomic Factors; Maps; Migration; Natural Resources; Needs; Obstacles; Organization And Administration; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Public Health; Research Methodology; Rural Population; Rural-urban Migration; Sanitation; Southern Asia; Spatial Distribution; Urban Population; Water Supply; spatial distribution; agriculture; drinking water; water supply; agriculture; article; Asia; audiovisual equipment; climate; Consumption; Critique; data analysis; Data Quality; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; disaster; drought; Economic Factors; economics; environment; environmental protection; Geographic Factors; geography; health; health service; India; Macroeconomic Factors; methodology; migration; Natural Resources; Needs; Obstacles; organization and management; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; public health; research; Research Methodology; rural population; Rural-urban Migration; sanitation; Southern Asia; urban population; water supply","","","","","","","Chambers R., Farmers above the outlet: irrigation and canal management in South Asia, Journ. of Indian Water Resources Society, 6, 3, pp. 9-22, (1986); Dastane N.G., Singh M., Mukeri S.B., Vemadevan V.K., Review of work done on water requirements of crops in India, (1966); New Delhi, 1, 9, (1989); Towards a human Settlement Policy in India — 2001, (1975); Learmonth A.T.A., Akhatar R., Cultural patterns and health and diseases in India, India: Cultural Patterns and Processes, pp. 287-299, (1982); Money D.C., Arid Lands: Characteristics and Development, (1982); Ramgopal, An Economic Model India — 1948–61, (1970); Roy B.K., Agricultural typology in India: some issues, Perspective in Agricultural Typology, pp. 148-157, (1986); Roy B.K., An approach to regionalisation of types of farming in India, Economic and sociocultural dimensions of regionalisation — An Indo-USSR Collaborative Study, pp. 227-251, (1972); Roy B.K., Approach in Geographic Cartography of death statistics: some issues, Doab Geographer, 2, 1, pp. 13-17, (1986); Roy B.K., Are Wastelands the last Hope of the Poor, GeoJournal, 17, 1, pp. 117-124, (1988); Subrahmanyam V.P., Climatic types of India according to rational classification of Thornthwaite, Indian Journ of Met. & Geophysics, 54, pp. 253-264, (1956); Vohra B.B., Towards a national water policy, BHU-JAL, 3, 1, pp. 3-4, (1986)","","","Kluwer Academic Publishers","","","","","","15729893","","GEOJD","12317929","English","GeoJournal","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025572169"

The mean rate of normal delivery was 92.59%, that of Caesarean was 3.09%, that of wantose was 1.52% and finally that of forceps was 1.31%. Caesarean and wantose (vacuum extractor) delivery types showed an increasing trend, whereas the normal and forceps delivery types showed a decreased trend during the period under study. The secondary sex ratio was the highest in 1977 and the lowest in 1983 with a mean of 105.18. The twinning rate showed a decreasing trend during the above period.; 616,638 births during the 1967-83 period in a maternity hospital in Tehran, Iran, were studied in an effort to report various types of delivery and sex ratio as well as the rate of multibirths over this 17-year period. Table 1 shows the annual births for males and females during 1967-83. It is evident that the highest birth numbers occurred in 1974--41,196--and the lowest in 1978--29,344. Table 2 shows the types of delivery. Normal delivery ranged from 95.68% in 1969 to 88.18% in 1978 with a mean of 92.59%. Cesarean delivery increased from 1.80% in 1967 to 6.36 in 1983. Forceps delivery type showed different frequencies--from 0.23% (1970-71) to 2.80% (1967). Wantose delivery type also showed different frequencies from nil (1976) to 3.84% (1979). Figure 1 shows the changes of the secondary sex ratio. The secondary sex ratio ranged from 102.67 in 1982 to 107.26 in 1977 with a mean of 105.18. Table 3 shows the rate of multibirths. The rate of twins has had different frequencies--from 1/75.13 births (1967) to 1/115.45 births (1982 with a total mean of 1/94.42 births. Twin births decreased over the period. The triplet births also showed different rates--1/4552.89 births (1968) to 1/302,207 births (1978) with a total mean of 1/14,014.5 births. Quadruplets occurred only once (1979). The study shows that the birth number depends on the economic and political factors--a high number in 1971 which was nearly the beginning of the economic development in Iran and by the lowest number in 1978 which was the prerevolutionary period. Sex ratio increased during 1976-78 because of the migration of the rural population to Tehran. Consequently, the changes of the secondary ratio over the 17-year period have been influenced by the said factors of the time of insemination and the couples' sexual activity. These factors are influenced by the economic, geographic, and psychic environment, nutrition, and other cultural factors. Many social factors for sex ratio and the rate of the secondary sex ratio are responsible for influencing the trend of delivery types, especially for the decreased trend of normal delivery and the increased trend of Cesarean delivery types.","","Birth Rate; Cesarean Section; Extraction, Obstetrical; Female; Human; Infant, Newborn; Iran; Male; Pregnancy; Sex Ratio; Triplets; Twins; Asia; Birth Rate; Data Analysis; Delivery; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; Iran; Macroeconomic Factors; Measurement; Obstetrical Surgery; Political Factors; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Size; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Reproduction; Research Methodology; Sex Distribution; Sex Factors; Sex Ratio; Socioeconomic Factors; Southern Asia; Surgery; article; Asia; birth rate; cesarean section; data analysis; delivery; Demographic Factors; developing country; Economic Factors; female; fertility; Fertility Measurements; forceps delivery; human; Iran; Macroeconomic Factors; male; measurement; multiple pregnancy; newborn; Obstetrical Surgery; Political Factors; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; population size; pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; reproduction; Research Methodology; sex difference; sex ratio; socioeconomics; Southern Asia; surgery; twins","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00035548","","","3740819","English","Anthropol Anz","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022731883"

Cumulative fertility, when controlled for duration of marriage, was found to be higher in urban than in rural areas of Bangladesh and Pakistan, but no clear pattern emerged in Jordan. In Java, both current and cumulative fertility were higher in urban than in rural areas; urban women who had spent their childhood and were brought up in the urban environment showed, in most instances, higher fertility than the other residence groups. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.

With specific reference to field research on population movement conducted amongst individuals, households, small groups, and village communities in third world societies, it challenges the convention that both generalization and extrapolation are based inevitably and exclusively on the number of cases or events subject to examination. An evaluation is made of the methodological aspects of four different studies of population mobility at microscale, undertaken between 1965 and 1977 in the Solomon Islands and northwest Thailand. On this basis, integrated field designs that incorporate a range of intersecting instruments are favoured for their technical flexibility and logical strength. With case studies of third world villages, market centres, and urban neighbourhoods, generalization and extrapolation is based on depth of understanding and the power of theoretical connections. © 1987 D.

The estimates were obtained from retrospective reports of women enumerated at the 1911 Census, and covered the period from approximately 1895 to 1910. Infant mortality by father's occupation underwent an average decline of 35% from a peak infant mortality rate (IMR) of 132, with wide variation. The removal of poor (usually urban) residential conditions was probably associated with the decline, but, except at the extremes, income did not explain the differences. In the 97 great towns, the subject of this study, where the average decline in IMR was also 35% from a peak of 146, the rate of urbanization over 20 years accounted for a significant proportion of the differential decline, and measures of poverty added little to the explanation.

Following a discussion of the various definitional and boundary‐matching issues arising from the use of the Census of Canada, results are presented in tabular and map form. Although rural growth rates did in all likelihood exceed urban rates in the 1970s, the extent of this turnaround is undoubtedly exaggerated in the census data, primarily because of definitional and reclassification effects. Moreover, setting aside data‐related anomalies, there is strong evidence that much of this rural population growth was in fact ‘spillover’ from urban centres. Cet essai traite du virage pris par la population rurale au Canada au moyen d'une décomposition et d'une analyse des taux de croissance rurale où interviennent(1) les deux décennies 1961–71 et 197 1–81, (2) les com‐posantes agricoles et non‐agricoles de la population rurale, (3) les régions définies sur une base provinciale, et (4) les types de zones établies à partir de la proximité par rapport aux centres urbains. Les problèmes de définition et de démarcation d'aires comparables soulevés par I'utilisation des données du Recensement du Canada sont abordés en premier lieu. Puis, les résultats sont présentés sous forme de cartes et de tableaux. Bien que les taux de croissance rurale aient, selon toute vraisemblance, dépassé les taux urbains dans les années 70, I'ampleur de ce virage réulte sans doute d'exagérations dans les données du recensement, prin‐cipalement attribuables aux effets de délimitation et de reclassification. De plus, mises à part les anomalies relatives aux données, il y ade bonnes raisons de croire que cette croissance de la population rurale provient en grande partie du décongestionnement des centres urbains.

Bundelkhand region--a distinct histocultural and geographic unit--is a transitional zone between the 2 major physiographic divisions of India: the Gangetic plain and Peninsular India. The region is a less developed part of India where people are living in low social status with poor economic conditions; agriculture is the mainstay of the people, but the region suffers from the inadequacy and inefficiencies of irrigation facilities. The history of population growth of the region during the last 80 years has followed a multivariate course; besides the interplay of birth and death, in-migration contributes considerably to the population growth. The 1st phase (1901-1921) is that of progressive decline causing a very slow population growth--population decrease was mainly due to the influenza epidemic of 1918-19. The 2nd phase (1921-1951) was a period of moderate population growth due to the national political movements and disturbances together with some natural disasters. The 3rd phase (1951-1981) is marked by a rapid population growth mainly due to the decline in the death rate. Over the last 80 years, the total population of the Bundelkhand region increased from 3.45 million to 8.03 million--a net increase of 132.58%. However, this change is not high when compared to the national average of 176.11%. The total population of the region in 1981 (8,037,206 persons) is expected to reach 8,874,000 persons in 1991, and 9,797,000 persons in 2001. This will undoubtedly put enormous pressure on the resources of the region slowing down the pace of economic progress.","","Agriculture; Asia; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Forecasting; India; Mortality; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Research; Residential Mobility; Social Planning; Statistics; Agricultural Development; Asia; Data Analysis; Death Rate; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Development Planning; Economic Development; Estimation Technics; India; Macroeconomic Factors; Migration; Migration, Internal; Mortality; Natural Increase; Population; Population Decrease; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Population Projection; Research Methodology; Southern Asia; Agricultural Development; agriculture; article; Asia; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Development Planning; economic development; economics; Estimation Technics; forecasting; India; Macroeconomic Factors; migration; Migration, Internal; mortality; Natural Increase; policy; population; Population Decrease; population dynamics; population growth; Population Projection; research; Research Methodology; Southern Asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","02565331","","","12179095","English","Popul Geogr","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021437367"

From October 1979 to September 1984, the US Agency for International Development (AID) funded the Research Triangle Institute's (RTI) Integrated Population and Development Planning (IPDP) project to assess rapid population growth effects in 25 developing countries. In October 1984, US AID extended funding for the program, nicknamed INPLAN, for 3 years, at a cost of $6.3 million. Up to 50% of people in developing countries are under age 15, a fact that guarantees large population increases for the next 50-75 years. Also, many regions have been slow to correlate high fertility with socioeconomic development, and in some areas, fertility is actually increasing. INPLAN aims to make governments more aware of population dynamics and to provide training and tools for effective development planning. 40% of INPLAN's work will be done in Africa, 25% in Latin America, and 20% in Asia, with some activity in the Near East. One project in Egypt, involving the use of model generation by microcomputer, was developed by RTI to show rural to urban migration and rapid population growth affects on the educational system. INPLAN expects to develop several other planning sector models on labor force and employment, health and family planning, food supply, housing, and urban development, and apply them to 20-25 countries. Another project provided 9 microcomputer systems and training to Nigerian government agencies. IMPLAN will purchase and distribute 60 such systems in the future.","","Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Africa, Northern; Africa, Western; Automatic Data Processing; Computers; Delivery of Health Care; Developing Countries; Egypt; Forecasting; Government Agencies; Health; Health Services; Latin America; Middle East; Nigeria; Organizations; Population Control; Public Policy; Research; Statistics; Africa; Africa South Of The Sahara; Arab Countries; Computers; Delivery Of Health Care; Developing Countries; Egypt; English Speaking Africa; Estimation Technics; Government Agencies; Health; Health Services; Information; Information Processing; Latin America; Mediterranean Countries; Nigeria; Northern Africa; Organizations; Policy; Population Control; Population Forecast; Population Policy; Population Programs; Research Methodology; Social Policy; Usaid; Western Africa; Africa; Africa south of the Sahara; Arab Countries; article; computer; developing country; Egypt; English Speaking Africa; Estimation Technics; forecasting; government; health; health care delivery; health service; information; information processing; Mediterranean Countries; Middle East; Nigeria; Northern Africa; organization; policy; population dynamics; Population Forecast; Population Policy; Population Programs; research; Research Methodology; South and Central America; Usaid; Western Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12314095","English","Hypotenuse","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021516533"

The Beijing city government conducted a large scale survey on this problem in April, 1985. According to an earlier, incomplete survey, in 1983 the daily average transient population reached approximately 500,000-600,000. The April, 1985 survey showed the number of temporary residents in the city to be 870,000. The concentration of the flow is no longer limited to before and after the Chinese new year, or during summer months; it is now a year round event. The railroad is the chief means of transportation for this influx. The flow can be divided into 3 categories: 18% to visit friends and relatives; 45.1% to study, attend conferences, conduct business, or tour the city. Other temporary visitors include people seeking employment and sellers at farm markets. By the end of this survey a new kind of flow had emerged: Beijing's textile, rubber, and leather industries had begun to attract workers from the villages, who commute daily. Many are concerned about how this uncontrolled flow could unfavorably influence Beijing's natural growth. The survey proposed taking appropriate measures to utilize this population flow and ease the conflicts it causes. To accomplish this, the city government must determine the mechanics of the flow as well as improve city management in order to respond to the challenge. The city government's responsibility should not be limited to making policies and regulations; it should delegate management and settlement of the transient population to the appropriate departments. Emphasis should be placed on providing information through the media about room and board and transportation, improving the transportation system, incorporating the farm markets into city planning, and strengthening security and supervision.","","Asia; China; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; English Abstract; Far East; Geography; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Residence Characteristics; Residential Mobility; Social Planning; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; Transportation; Asia; China; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Development Planning; Eastern Asia; Economic Development; Geographic Factors; Macroeconomic Factors; Migrants; Migration; Migration, Internal; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Residence Characteristics; Spatial Distribution; Transportation; spatial distribution; article; Asia; China; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Development Planning; Eastern Asia; economic development; economics; Far East; Geographic Factors; geography; Macroeconomic Factors; Migrants; migration; Migration, Internal; policy; population; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; traffic and transport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10006087","","","12280623","Chinese","Renkou Yanjiu","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022707647"

It is based on a demographic exploration of this rural economic island in 1978-79 during which, among other things, data on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of migrants were collected. Data was collected using 2 separate questionnaires administered to heads of households and married females of reproductive ages 15-49 years. The survey concentrated on unskilled laborerers on the plantations as well as their counterparts in the factories. Emphasis is placed on age statistics, sex differential, fertility, mortality, and mobility measurements of migrants, using appropriate demographic technics. The salient findings are: that age reporting problems detected are common to those in estimated censuses as well as other surveys; this rural-rural migration is highly selective of males; migrants have lower fertility and mortality than non-migrants in the districts of out-migration; and a substantial proportion of migrants are temporary, expecting to return to their homes or repeat migrate elsewhere. Given the similarities between census and survey enumeration, it is concluded that demographic measurements of the 2 population categories are fairly identical, although some allowance must be made for errors inherent in sample surveys. Differences that exist are attributed to the bulge of migrants in the 20-29 year age group, and the dominance of old-age males.","","Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Africa, Eastern; Censuses; Comparative Study; Data Collection; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Fertility; Health Manpower; Kenya; Mortality; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research; Residential Mobility; Rural Population; Sampling Studies; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; Africa; Africa South Of The Sahara; Census; Comparative Studies; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Demographic Surveys; Developing Countries; Eastern Africa; Economic Factors; English Speaking Africa; Fertility; Human Resources; Kenya; Labor Force; Migrant Workers; Migrants; Migration; Migration, Internal; Mortality; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Statistics; Research Methodology; Research Report; Rural Population; Rural-urban Migration; Sampling Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Studies; Surveys; Temporary Migration; census; Africa; Africa south of the Sahara; article; Comparative Studies; comparative study; data analysis; Demographic Factors; Demographic Surveys; demography; developing country; Eastern Africa; Economic Factors; economics; employment; English Speaking Africa; epidemiology; fertility; health care manpower; Human Resources; information processing; Kenya; Labor Force; Migrant Workers; Migrants; migration; Migration, Internal; mortality; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; population research; Population Statistics; research; Research Methodology; Research Report; rural population; Rural-urban Migration; social class; social status; socioeconomics; Studies; Surveys; Temporary Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00166987","","","12267540","English","Genus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021781767"

Following proclamation of British Imperial Rule in 1857, mortality rates in Bangladesh began to decline as a result of preventive measures against natural disasters such as draught and famine, but the fertility rate remained unaltered. The demographic pattern was unstable over time, reflecting the impact of the influenza epidemic of 1918-19, war, migration, and economic development. Population growth accelerated greatly during the 1961-74 period, when industrialization emerged and job opportunities were created in the urban centers. Economic hardship, food shortages, and the introduction of family planning curbed urban growth drastically and total growth to some extent in 1974-81. On the average, growth has been higher in the Dhaka and Chittagong Divisions of Bangladesh than in the Khulna and Rajshahi Divisions. Differences in population growth among the regions are attributable largely to internal and external migration. The regression polynomial model best fits past population trends in Bangladesh and can reproduce the observed population by 99.60%. This polynomial is most suitable for graduation and prediction of population trends.","","Asia; Bangladesh; Comparative Study; Demography; Developing Countries; Fertility; Forecasting; Geography; Models, Theoretical; Mortality; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Regression Analysis; Research; Statistics; Asia; Bangladesh; Comparative Studies; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Estimation Technics; Fertility--changes; Geographic Factors; Historical Survey; Mathematical Model; Models, Theoretical; Mortality--changes; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Growth--changes; Population Projection; Research Methodology; Southern Asia; Spatial Distribution; Statistical Regression; Statistical Studies; spatial distribution; article; Asia; Bangladesh; Comparative Studies; comparative study; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Estimation Technics; fertility; Fertility--changes; forecasting; Geographic Factors; geography; Historical Survey; mathematical model; mortality; Mortality--changes; population; population dynamics; population growth; Population Growth--changes; Population Projection; regression analysis; research; Research Methodology; Southern Asia; Statistical Regression; Statistical Studies; theoretical model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10103783","","","12280834","English","Rural Demogr","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022274514"

This paper explores the determinants of population and employment densities interregionally. The theoretical model, due to Steinnes and Fisher, permits simultaneous determination of population and employment densities. This is applied to data for about 3,000 counties in the U.S. to analyze the effects of economic, demographic, climatic, and policy‐related variables on the growth of population and employment, during the 1970s. Considering employment, differential county growth is explained in terms of economic and demographic conditions; regional and policy variables matter less. For population, climate matters as a preference for sunbelt states is found. Local government programs regarding education and tax policy seem to play a role. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

It is the Weather Bureau, not the Census Bureau, that makes forecasts. Weatherpeople do have a rather detailed ""model"" to go on that basically stays the same -- the earth and its atmosphere. Their model is filled with precedents to guide them. Demographers, by contrast, often have to make do with scanty or missing data, poor quality data, unpredictable behavior patterns, and many other obstacles. They consequently are quick to point out that their projections are based on assumptions for the future applied to current data, and even those ""current data"" may themselves contain assumptions. Projections themselves are never ""wrong."" Anyone can make perfect projections. The process of projecting a population is actually a fairly simple series of rote mathematical calculations, applying the components of change, fertility, mortality, and migration, to each age cohort. Yet, what good is a perfect projection, if the assumptions behind the projection turn out to be incorrect. Generally, it is best for demographers to use words like ""expect"" sparingly. When dealing with the population of large areas, such as Africa, it would seem that a medium projection would be a relatively safe number to quote, since it could be anticipated that the projections for individual African countries would be either too high and/or too low. It would be reasonable to expect a fair number of compensating errors. Yet, if concern is with a single country, then it would be best to expand the vision beyond medium projections. Future country populations can easily vary by factors of 3 and 4, while that of the entire region follows the medium projections rather well. Then, 1 Golden Rule of projections could be set down: the smaller the geographic area, the more one needs to inquire ""how the trick was done."" Everyone across the demographic spectrum concedes that someday population growth on earth must cease, simply because the total numbers eventually become so large. Because of that premise, for the sake of projecting future ""stationary"" population, the tendency is to assume that the 2-child family will be reached and forever maintained. Recently, very low birthrates have been reported in Europe, and some demographers are discussing whether the future holds longterm population decline, rather than the stationary population of replacement level fertility. The entire subject remains cloudy. Mortality assumptions usually play a much less important role than fertility. 1 reason to run projections is that the results of seemingly small shifts in assumptions can produce surprisingly different future populations. Projections are needed and desired, but in many ways are not ""user friendly.""","","Birth Rate; Demography; Fertility; Forecasting; Mortality; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Research Design; Social Sciences; Statistics; Birth Rate; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Demography; Estimation Technics; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; Fertility Rate; Measurement; Mortality; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Projection; Research Methodology; Social Sciences; reproduction rate; article; birth rate; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; Estimation Technics; fertility; Fertility Measurements; forecasting; measurement; methodology; mortality; population; population dynamics; Population Projection; research; Research Methodology; sociology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","07492448","","","12267720","English","Popul Today","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022505313"

Individual characteristics that have been identified as affecting fertility, such as age at, and duration of marriage, occupation and educational status are examined. The results indicate that 17.5% of the women marry before the age of 15, and 94% are married by 24 years of age. On the whole, monogamous and polygamous marriages are fairly stable among women of all groups; 91.9% and 94.5% of marriages among urban women in Western Nigeria were unbroken at the time of survey in 1969. Monogamy prevails, but women with no formal education are more likely to be polygamous than women with some formal education. 62.9% of the sample population have had primary education and higher although indigenous urban women tend to have obtained higher education. Urban fertility is high Nigeria. The total fertility rate for Benin is 7.860 and the average number of children is 3.406 per women respectively. The estimated annual rate of growth for Benin is 8.6, which reflects a faster rate of growth than other urban centers. In keeping with previous findings, fertility levels of migrant women were found to be higher than those of urban dwellers. However, the issue of higher rural versus higher urban fertility is still unresolved, and further investigation is needed.","","Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Africa, Western; Age Factors; Birth Rate; Comparative Study; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Educational Status; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Fertility; Marriage; Nigeria; Occupational Health Services; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research; Residential Mobility; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; Urban Population; Africa; Africa South Of The Sahara; Age Factors; Comparative Studies; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Differential Fertility; Economic Factors; Educational Status; Employment Status; Employment-based Services; English Speaking Africa; Fertility; Fertility Determinants; Fertility Measurements; Fertility Surveys; Marriage; Marriage Duration; Marriage Patterns; Migrants; Migration; Nigeria; Nuptiality; Occupational Status; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Research Report; Rural-urban Migration; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Studies; Urban Population; Western Africa; nuptiality; Africa; Africa south of the Sahara; age; article; birth rate; Comparative Studies; comparative study; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Differential Fertility; Economic Factors; economics; employment; Employment Status; Employment-based Services; English Speaking Africa; fertility; Fertility Determinants; Fertility Measurements; Fertility Surveys; marriage; Marriage Duration; Marriage Patterns; Migrants; migration; Nigeria; occupational health service; Occupational Status; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; Research Report; Rural-urban Migration; social class; social status; socioeconomics; Studies; urban population; Western Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12282071","English","PAN","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022163129"

The authors' estimates of the determinants of fertility, however, is flawed by the absence of precise, sharply focused hypotheses. It is unclear what is being measured by the dependent variable--children ever born to women aged 15-50 years. The rationale for splitting the survey population into 4 variables (urban metropolitan areas, urban nonmetropolitan areas, rural farms, and rural nonfarm areas) is also unclear. The entry into a presentation of regression results is often precipitous, without clarification as to what factors such as tractor ownership measure. The coefficient of the results on breastfeeding is inconsistent with the results on the effects of income and well-being on fertility. The paper also would have benefited from more detailed study of birth intervals.

The hypothesis subsumed by the duration of residence variable is that the longer the period a migrant lives in an area, the more he gets assimilated into the practices of the indigenes.

Month of conception was inferred by counting back 9 months from date of birth. Over 4300 births, occurring between 1758 and 1964 and spanning the years that the colonies inhabited the Ukraine and then migrated to the United States and Canada, were included in the analysis. When combined, the European and North American births showed a seasonal pattern with a general rise in conceptions from December to June followed by a decline in conceptions from July to November. The major peaks in conceptions were in April and June, with a minor peak in December. Separate examination of the European and American records revealed a secular change. The seasonality of North American conceptions was dramatically reduced when compared to the very distinct European seasonal pattern. It is assumed that both biological and cultural factors are responsible for the seasonal variation observed. The influences of light cycle, date of marriage, and work and holiday schedules on conception rates are discussed. © 1986, Cambridge University Press.

The most traditional methods are based on the use of the census information obtained from a question on place of birth. This question also serves to measure emigration using census data on the countries of destination. Other questions on migration are also used; i.e., year of arrival and place of residence 5 years prior to census date. The estimations presented are classified according to 4 different types of migrants. Some results of the international migration of Paraguay are also presented in this paper. Among the most recent methods, the ideas of Jorge Somoza are followed to measure emigration. Such information is gathered from special questions included in a census or survey regarding place of residence of surviving children and their mothers, with an application to the data of the 2nd Honduras National Demographic Survey in 1983. In order to measure immigration, a special solution is applied through the use of vital statistics with regard to maternal birthplace for those women whose children are registered.

For this purpose, 3 revised and new demographic techniques were used and reliability of outcome checked by comparing results against 1 another. The techniques are the Brass P/F technique, the Gompertz relational model (Brass 1977), and a method based on estimation of fertility from number of children ever-born, tabulated by duration of marriage (Coale, Hill, and Trussel 1975). The estimates based on census questions also serve to verify the estimates obtained directly from vital registration data. Results show that the fertility rates of the native population derived from different techniques are very close, and the patterns of fertility derived from census data and viltal registration data are quite similar. For the non-Kuwait population, the rates derived by different methods are not as reliable as for the native population. The level of non-Kuwait fertility is lower than their Kuwait counterparts, and the registered rates are lower than the estimates derived from census estimates. Although it is difficult to be certain about the extent of underregistration of births of non-Kuwaitis, it seems that 10-15% of non-Kuwaiti births are omitted from the registration system. When the fertility data are plotted by age, the similarity in the pattern of fertility between Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis becomes clearer For both groups, the peak age of fertility is in the age group 25-29. The curve from the registration data is very close to the curve from the census dats. Thus, it seems that the registration data around 1980 underestimate the level of fertility but give a nearly accurate picture of the age pattern of non-Kuwaite fertility.","","Age Factors; Asia; Asia, Western; Birth Rate; Censuses; Comparative Study; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Fertility; Health Manpower; Kuwait; Marriage; Maternal Age; Middle East; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Registries; Research; Research Design; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; Vital Statistics; Age Factors; Age Specific Fertility Rate; Arab Countries; Asia; Birth Rate; Brass Technic; Census; Comparative Studies; Data Analysis; Demographic Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Error Sources; Estimation Technics; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; Fertility Rate; Human Resources; Indirect Estimation Technics; Kuwait; Labor Force; Marriage Duration; Maternal Age; Measurement; Migrant Workers; Migrants; Migration; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Register; Population Statistics; Research Methodology; Research Report; Studies; Vital Statistics; Western Asia; census; reproduction rate; age; Age Specific Fertility Rate; Arab Countries; article; Asia; birth rate; Brass Technic; Comparative Studies; comparative study; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Economic Factors; economics; employment; Error Sources; Estimation Technics; fertility; Fertility Measurements; health care manpower; Human Resources; Indirect Estimation Technics; Kuwait; Labor Force; marriage; Marriage Duration; maternal age; measurement; methodology; Middle East; Migrant Workers; Migrants; migration; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; Population Register; population research; Population Statistics; register; research; Research Methodology; Research Report; Studies; vital statistics; Western Asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12267383","English","Popul Bull U N Econ Comm West Asia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022072653"

They next look at the migration data using first longitudinal analysis and then cross-sectional analysis. Results, at least for this example, show that cross-sectional analysis of migration has the advantage over longitudinal analysis of allowing the correlations between changes in migration patterns and particular historical events to be seen more readily.","","Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Africa, Northern; Africa, Western; Bias (Epidemiology); Burkina Faso; Comparative Study; Cross-Sectional Studies; Demography; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; English Abstract; Longitudinal Studies; Methods; Population; Population Dynamics; Reproducibility of Results; Research; Research Design; Residential Mobility; Retrospective Studies; Statistics; Africa; Africa South Of The Sahara; Bias; Burkina Faso; Comparative Studies; Cross Sectional Analysis; Data Analysis; Demographic Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Error Sources; French Speaking Africa; Historical Survey; Longitudinal Studies; Measurement; Methodological Studies; Migration; Migration, Internal; Population; Population Dynamics; Reliability; Research Methodology; Retrospective Studies; Studies; Western Africa; bias; Africa; Africa south of the Sahara; article; Burkina Faso; Comparative Studies; comparative study; Cross Sectional Analysis; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; epidemiology; Error Sources; French Speaking Africa; Historical Survey; longitudinal study; measurement; Methodological Studies; methodology; migration; Migration, Internal; population; population dynamics; prevalence; reliability; reproducibility; research; Research Methodology; retrospective study; Studies; technique; Western Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00166987","","","12267210","French","Genus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021452769"

In order to make an estimate the technique based on the increase in the mean number of children born alive related to each age group is used. The estimated results correspond to the 2 inter-census periods (approximately 1973-78). For this reason the results based on only the fertility data of Population Census and the surveys held by HIPS in 1973-78, respectively, are argued. When the estimated fertility figures based on the data for the ever-married women between 15-49 age groups (tables 1-3), and the total number of women in these age groups (tables 4-6), related to the 1970-80 interval for inter-census periods, are compared within themselves and with each other, some points come into question that need to be taken into consideration. One of the points in question is the estimates related to 1975-80 period. Obviously, the fertility estimates based on the married women are higher than the estimates based on total number of women, because the number of married women years lived is higher. If one evaluates the estimated results within a fertility pattern, it could be said that the total fertility rate for 1975-80 (6.40) periods is a high estimate. The 2nd point to be questioned is that whether the estimated increase in the total marital fertility rate is an actual increase or not for 1970-75 and 1975-80 periods, because the regional and national surveys held in these periods show a decrease in the fertility rates. Also the estimates of the multiple reverse projection techniques based on Population Census indicate that the fertility rates decreased in time and reached its lowest rate (5.05) for the 1970-75 period. When working on Population Census, the data either related to the past year or related to the past 5 years are to be consistent if there hasn't been a great change in fertility. Therefore, a cautious data clearing process has to be undertaken to eliminate all research errors. As an example, one can see from the 1980 population data that 1859 of ever-married women have 4, 498 have 5, 123 have 6, and 27 have 7 living children. In the author's opinion the underclearing of the data is the cause for these figures. On the other hand, if the fertility figures of ever-married women related to the last 5 years are evaluated according to their permanent residences 5 years before the census date, some errors of estimation may be prevented. As expected, if this data is evaluated within the context of the widely approved urban-rural definition, it will be of great value for the planning and implementing organizations. author's modified","","Asia; Asia, Western; Birth Rate; Censuses; Comparative Study; Demography; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; English Abstract; Fertility; Maternal Age; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Reproducibility of Results; Research; Research Design; Statistics; Turkey; Age Specific Fertility Rate; Asia; Birth Rate; Census; Comparative Studies; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Error Sources; Estimation Technics; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; Fertility Rate; Measurement; Mediterranean Countries; Migration; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Statistics; Reliability; Research Methodology; Total Fertility Rate; Turkey; Undercount; Western Asia; census; reproduction rate; Age Specific Fertility Rate; article; Asia; birth rate; Comparative Studies; comparative study; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Error Sources; Estimation Technics; fertility; Fertility Measurements; maternal age; measurement; Mediterranean Countries; methodology; migration; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; population research; Population Statistics; reliability; reproducibility; research; Research Methodology; Total Fertility Rate; turkey; Turkey (republic); Undercount; Western Asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12159459","Turkish","Nufusbil Derg","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021563743"

When they controlled for other variables, differentials existed only for place of residence, religion, and education. Women living in urban areas were more likely to be migrants than nonmigrants (26.9% vs. 18.6%; p.01). Christians also tended to be migrants (92.3% vs. 7.7%; p/01). Yet the coefficient of the interaction between place of residence and Christian was strongly negative (p.01). Thus the odds of an urban resident being a migrant was reduced from 1.46-1.15 when considering Christians. Among Christians, differences in education between migrants and nonmigrants was small. On the other hand, the more educated a Muslim woman was the less likely she was a migrant (p.05). Further all socioeconomic differentials were consistently significant at either the 1% or 5% level for women who migrated 2 times, but not for primary migrants or return migrants. Women who migrated 3 times and those who migrated back to where they had lived earlier, but not to place of birth, were different than nonmigrants in terms of occupation and education only. In the early 1970s, armed conflicts between Muslims and Christians and between government troops and Muslim groups resulted in considerable displacement of families. Yet this conflict could only account for differentials between the 2 religious groups before 1975, but these data could not infer other reasons for migration. Researchers should explore these reasons. These result indicated that policy makers should focus on religious and place of residence differentials rather than migrant/nonmigrant differentials to promote equality among groups of women.","","Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Christianity; Comparative Study; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Geography; Health Services Accessibility; Islam; Methods; Philippines; Politics; Population; Population Dynamics; Regression Analysis; Religion; Research; Residence Characteristics; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; War; Women's Rights; Asia; Christianity; Comparative Studies; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Demographic Surveys; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Geographic Factors; Islam; Locale; Methodological Studies; Migrants--women; Migration; Nonmigrants--women; Philippines; Political Factors; Population; Population Dynamics; Religion; Research Methodology; Residence Characteristics; Return Migration; Socioeconomic Factors; Southeastern Asia; Spatial Distribution; Statistical Regression; Studies; War; Women's Status; spatial distribution; article; Asia; Comparative Studies; comparative study; data analysis; Demographic Factors; Demographic Surveys; demography; developing country; Economic Factors; economics; Geographic Factors; geography; health care delivery; human rights; Locale; Methodological Studies; Migrants--women; migration; Nonmigrants--women; Philippines; Political Factors; politics; population; population dynamics; regression analysis; religion; research; Research Methodology; Return Migration; socioeconomics; Southeast Asia; Southeastern Asia; Statistical Regression; Studies; technique; war; Women's Status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01167960","","","12317188","English","Philipp Popul J","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0023670694"

Infant—child mortality seems to have declined until the mid-1960s, stabilized for some years and even risen slightly in the latest period of the two surveys. Neonatal mortality is responsible for a high proportion of deaths under age 1 and is particularly high for first order births and children born to very young or very old mothers. Higher infant and childhood mortality are also related to these factors and also to a shorter preceding birth interval, the early death of the preceding child and sex of the child. Education of mother and residence were also found to be critical determinants of infant and child mortality. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.

Census counts for 1980 are also shown for each of the areas. Components of population change for these areas for the 1980-1986 period are also shown. Most of the statistics used to prepare the area estimates were obtained from the local governments of the outlying areas. Except for Puerto Rico, all of the areas estimated are growing at a rate well above that of the US (64% from April 1, 1980 to July 1, 1986). Of the areas, Guam has exhibited the highest % of growth since 1980--19.6%. Although Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands have increased in population since 1890, both experienced population declines between 1985 and 1986. The Virgin Islands' population declined by 1.2%, from 110,800 to 109,500, while Puerto Rico's decreased by 3%, from 3,282,000 to 3,274,000.","","American Samoa; Americas; Caribbean Region; Censuses; Data Collection; Demography; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Government Publications; Guam; Latin America; Micronesia; North America; Pacific Islands; Polynesia; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Puerto Rico; Research; Statistics; American Samoa; Americas; Caribbean; Census; Data Analysis; Data Collection; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Estimation Technics; Government Publication; Guam; International Migration--statistics; Latin America; Micronesia; Micronesia-polynesia; Migration; North America; Oceania; Polynesia; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Growth Estimation; Population Statistics; Puerto Rico; Research Methodology; Virgin Islands (united States); census; American Samoa; article; Central America; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; developing country; Estimation Technics; Federated States of Micronesia; Government Publication; Guam; information processing; International Migration--statistics; Micronesia-polynesia; migration; North America; Oceania; Pacific islands; Polynesia; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; population growth; Population Growth Estimation; population research; Population Statistics; Puerto Rico; research; Research Methodology; South and Central America; Virgin Islands (united States); Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0738453X","","","12280838","English","Curr Popul Rep Popul Estim Proj","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0023380879"

Fieldwork took place in April 1982 and April 1983 and analysis of data is currently underway. The survey had several objectives: a study of the concept of population pressure; a comparison of the role of population pressure in the rural exodus in 2 zones with similar densities but different migratory behavior; a study of levels, correlates, and consequences of migration for sending areas and the links between migrants and their places of origin; improvement of data collection techniques for migration research; and provision of data to assist in design of a rural development policy that would increase retention of rural population. The 2nd internal migration study is a survey of migration among secondary school students. Results of a pilot survey among 2408 students in the west and northwest provinces interviewed in March 1984 are being analyzed. The main survey is planned for January 1985 and is intended to measure the volume and duration of migration among students, to study the characteristics of migrants, and to analyze the causes of movements. The sample size is expected to be about 40,000. A pilot study for the survey of infant mortality in rural areas was begun in March 1984 and was intended primarily to determine the feasibility of data gathering techniques for a larger study of the levels and correlates of infant mortality. The methodology calls for the sample of newborns to be visted at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Arrondissements with high and low infant mortality are to be studied in 3 different ecological zones: sahelian, equatorial forest, and Sudanian. The hypothesis to be tested is that, if physical conditions are the same within a zone, demographic differentials must be explanied by cultural or socioeconomic factors which are amenable to modification by a suitable development policy. Samples of about 1000 newborns are to be followed in each of the 6 categories. The Department of Demographic Research has also undertaken development of a bibliographic data base for population studies in Cameroon. The data base, called POPCAM, has more than 2400 citations thus far.","","Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Africa, Northern; Cameroon; Data Collection; Demography; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; English Abstract; Infant Mortality; Mortality; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Residential Mobility; Sampling Studies; Statistics; Africa; Africa South Of The Sahara; Cameroon; Data Analysis; Data Collection; Demographic Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; French Speaking Africa; Infant Mortality; Middle Africa; Migration; Migration, Internal; Mortality; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Sampling Studies; Studies; Africa; Africa south of the Sahara; article; Cameroon; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; epidemiology; French Speaking Africa; infant mortality; information processing; Middle Africa; migration; Migration, Internal; mortality; population; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10131396","","","12339835","French","Bull Liaison Demogr Afr","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021383967"

Breast-feeding is shown to be the most important limiting factor, resulting in a reduction of about six children per woman. Decline in the duration of breast-feeding by one-fourth would increase fertility by one additional child per woman. The temporary separation of spouses due to migration is conjectured to be the second most important fertility inhibiting factor, not explicitly accounted for in the standard model.

Empirical analyses using migration data for states in the U.S. over 1955-1960, 1965-1970, and 1975-1980 show that the intrinsic mechanism may swamp the compositional effect. © 1989 The Regional Science Association.","","USA; data analysis; inmigration; migration rate; outmigration; population composition","","","","","","","Bogue D.J., Shryock H.S., Hoerman S.A., Streams of migration between subregions: a pilot study of migration flows between environments, vol. 1, subregional migration in the United State, 1935–40, (1957); Da Vanzo J., Why families move: a model of the geographic mobility of married couples, (1976); Gleave D., Cordey-Hayes M., Migration dynamics and labor turnover, Progress in Planning, 8, pp. 1-95, (1977); Kriesberg E.M., Vining D.R., On the contribution of out-migration to changes in net migration: a time series confirmation of Beale's cross-sectional results, Annals of Regional Science, 12, pp. 1-11, (1978); Lieberson S., The interpretation of net migration rates, Sociological methodology, pp. 176-90, (1980); Lowry I.S., Migration and metropolitan growth: two analytical models, (1966); Miller A., The migration of employed persons to and from metropolitan areas of the United States, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 62, pp. 1418-32, (1967); Miller E., Is out-migration affected by economic conditions?, Southern Economic Journal, 39, pp. 396-405, (1973); Morrison P.A., Chronic movers and the future redistribution of population: a longitudinal analysis, Demography, 8, pp. 171-84, (1971); Perloff H.S., Dunn E.S., Lampard E.E., Muth R.F., Regions, resources, and economic growth, (1960); Plane D., Rogerson P., Rosen A., The cross-regional variation of in-migration and outmigration, Geographical Analysis, 16, pp. 162-75, (1984); Ravenstein E.G., The laws of migration, part 1, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 48, pp. 167-227, (1885); Renshaw V., The relationship of gross migration to net migration: a short run, long run distinction, Regional Science Perspectives, 5, pp. 109-24, (1975); Rogers A., The multiregional matrix growth operator and the stable interregional age structure, Demography, 3, pp. 537-44, (1966); Stone L.O., Stable migration rates from the multiregional growth matrix operator, Demography, 5, pp. 439-42, (1968); Stone L.O., On the correlation between metropolitan in-migration and out-migration by occupation, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 66, pp. 693-701, (1971); Tabuchi T., Time series modeling of gross migration and dynamic equilibrium, Journal of Regional Science, 25, pp. 65-83, (1985); Vanderkamp J., Migration flows, their determinants and the effects of return migration, Journal of Political Economy, 79, pp. 1012-31, (1971)","","","Springer-Verlag","","","","","","14355957","","","","English","Pap.

Data indicate that cityward migrants have lower actual and attitude fertility than nonmigrants at the place of origin, but similar or higher than that of urban nonmigrants. It appears that as education, age at marriage, independent living, involvement of children in choice of spouse, income, involvement in outside activities, exposure to mass media, ownership of modern durable goods, perception of less importance of a male heir, and aspirations for children's higher education increase, the number of children born and wanted declines, as does the preference for boys over girls.","","Asia; Behavior; China; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Educational Status; Emigration and Immigration; Family Characteristics; Far East; Fertility; Multivariate Analysis; Population; Population Dynamics; Psychology; Research; Residential Mobility; Sex; Sex Behavior; Social Class; Social Values; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Taiwan; Transients and Migrants; Asia; Behavior; China; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Differential Fertility; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; Educational Status; Family And Household; Family Characteristics; Family Size; Family Size, Desired; Family Size, Expected; Fertility; Fertility Determinants; Migrants; Migration; Multivariate Analysis; Population; Population Dynamics; Psychological Factors; Reproductive Behavior--determinants; Research Methodology; Research Report; Rural-urban Migration; Sex Preference; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Statistical Studies; Taiwan; Value Orientation; article; Asia; behavior; China; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Differential Fertility; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; economics; Family And Household; family size; Family Size, Desired; Family Size, Expected; Far East; fertility; Fertility Determinants; Migrants; migration; multivariate analysis; population; population dynamics; Psychological Factors; psychology; Reproductive Behavior--determinants; research; Research Methodology; Research Report; Rural-urban Migration; sex; Sex Preference; sexual behavior; social class; social psychology; social status; socioeconomics; Statistical Studies; Taiwan; Value Orientation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","05376998","","","12222428","English","Ingu munje nonjip","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0023360472"

The analysis is carried out on data from the 1980 National Household Survey (NHS). Additional information on specific country of residence allows the estimation of the number of Colombian emigrants present in Venezuela. The number of children who were living abroad at the time of the survey, classified by sex and by 5-year age group of mother, are used to estimate the total level of lifetime emigration and the age distribution of emigrants. Once the age distribution of surviving children is available, it is used to infer that of the emigrant children as reported by their mothers. In the case of Colombia, there were no emigrant sons reported by women under 30, and only 1 emigrant daughter was reported by women in that age group. The outcome implies not only that the incidence of independent emigration below age 15 is very low but also that it is probably not reflected accurately by a survey of the size of the 1980 NHS. Once the distribution of emigrants whose mothers are alive and living in their country of origin is obtained, it is a simple matter to adjust the figures for the incidence of maternal orphanhood. The estimation of those emigrating with their mothers is affected by the greatest degree of arbitrariness. Finally, to conclude the estimation procedure, allowance must be made for the incidence of orphanhood among the offspring of emigrant mothers. The emigration estimates derived from indirect data fall far short of the standards of reliability associated with other types of indirect estimates; nevertheless, they can be very useful tools in assessing the plausibility of claims that are too often the only information available on international migration.","","Age Distribution; Age Factors; Americas; Colombia; Data Collection; Demography; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Geography; Latin America; Methods; Mothers; Population; Population Dynamics; Reproducibility of Results; Research; Residence Characteristics; Sampling Studies; Sex Factors; South America; Statistics; Venezuela; Age Distribution; Age Factors; Americas; Colombia; Data Analysis; Demographic Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Estimation Technics; Geographic Factors; International Migration; Latin America; Methodological Studies; Migration--statistics; Mothers; Population; Population Dynamics; Reliability; Research Methodology; Research Report; Residence Characteristics; Sampling Studies; Sex Factors; South America; Spatial Distribution; Studies; Surveys; Venezuela; spatial distribution; age; age distribution; article; Colombia; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; developing country; epidemiology; Estimation Technics; Geographic Factors; geography; information processing; International Migration; Methodological Studies; migration; Migration--statistics; mother; population; population dynamics; reliability; reproducibility; research; Research Methodology; Research Report; sex difference; South America; South and Central America; Studies; Surveys; technique; Venezuela; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","02517604","","","12314309","English","Popul Bull UN","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022179026"

The transient population has contributed to the development, productivity, and supply of commodities to Shanghai, and increased the city's communication with other provinces, but measures should be taken to properly manage it. To better manage this problem, the following steps must be taken: 1) Survey the population -- number, composition, distribution, sources, and activity patterns; 2) Classify by profession and centralize management; 3) Establish methods for proper distribution and diversification of market and entertaining areas; and 4) Improve roads, communication, and hotel facilities.","","Asia; China; Demography; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; English Abstract; Far East; Politics; Population; Population Dynamics; Public Policy; Research; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; Asia; China; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Migrants; Migration; Policy; Political Factors; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Policy; Research Methodology; Social Policy; article; Asia; China; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Eastern Asia; Far East; Migrants; migration; policy; Political Factors; politics; population; population dynamics; Population Policy; research; Research Methodology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10006087","","","12341124","Chinese","Renkou Yanjiu","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022434135"

The projection assumes an increase in life expectancy for men and women respectively from 64.08 and 70.47 in 1980-85 and 77.00 in 2005-10. The migration assumption is that there will be a net loss of 529,274 Mexicans every 5 years. The total fertility rate is expected to decline from to 2.7. The total population was projected at 82.8 million in 1988, 104.0 million at the end of the century, and 123.2 million in 2010. The 0-14 age group will decline from 44.23% of the population in 1980 and 40.33% in 1985 to 31.41% in 2000 and 29.50% in 2010.

The implications for providing food and consumer goods, and especially for improving the quality of life are serious. The relative demand for primary and secondary education and for maternal-child health care will decline, but the demand for jobs and for family planning services will increase as the proportion of the population in the economically active age groups increases.","","Age Factors; Americas; Central America; Demography; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; English Abstract; Fertility; Forecasting; Geography; Latin America; Mexico; Mortality; North America; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Research; Statistics; Age Factors; Americas; Central America; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Estimation Technics; Fertility; Geographic Factors; Latin America; Mexico; Migration; Mortality; North America; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Population Projection; Research Methodology; Spatial Distribution; spatial distribution; age; article; Central America; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; developing country; Estimation Technics; fertility; forecasting; Geographic Factors; geography; Mexico; migration; mortality; North America; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; population growth; Population Projection; research; Research Methodology; South and Central America; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01877550","","","12158023","Spanish","Demos","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024154415"

To provide some illustrative empirical results, reference is made to the Philippine Migration Study (PMS), a research project which incorporates both internal and international migration in its research design. The study examined migration from Ilocos Norte to the principal internal destination, Manila, and the principal international destination, Honolulu. Ilocos Norte is a largely rural, resource poor province with a long history of outmigration that is attributable primarily to population pressure in the region. Due to the fact that 1 of the principal migration streams from the Ilocos is within the Philippines and the other is outside the country, the Ilocos presents an ideal situation for a comparative analysis of internal and international migration. The study consists of 7 different surveys conducted in Ilocos Norte, Manila, and Honolulu between 1980-83. More than 5000 interviews were conducted in the 3 locations. The initial baseline survey in Ilocos Norte was conducted in 1980. After 2-1/2 years, the initial 830 households in the Ilocos Baseline Survey were recontacted to determine the migration behavior of the household members since the 1st survey. Those who had moved to either Manila or Hawaii during this period were traced to the destination and interviewed there. The PMS uses a single integrated model (the value-expectancy or VE framework) to explore migration decision making for both internal and external migration. Despite the complexity of the VE questions, respondents were able to distinguish different locations as being relatively good places or bad places to realize their different goals. Manila was not highly regarded by Ilocanos in most respects, and there was not a single value on which Manila ranked higher than both alternative locations. Relative to the other values, however, Manila is seen as being a good place for educational opportunities and entertainment. Hawaii rated very well on items having to do with wealth and status, but was regarded as a relatively poor place to satisfy one's desire for affiliation. Comfort, affiliation, and morality were viewed as being most easily achieved in the present barangay. Based upon the value-expectancy framework, the findings of the Philippine Migration Study confirm that a global model of migration decision making is feasible and that other important concepts in migration equally apply well in the case of both internal and international population movements.","","Americas; Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Behavior; Decision Making; Demography; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Hawaii; Models, Theoretical; Motivation; North America; Philippines; Population; Population Dynamics; Psychology; Research; Residential Mobility; Statistics; United States; Americas; Asia; Behavior; Data Analysis; Decision Making; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Hawaii; International Migration; Migration; Migration, Internal; Models, Theoretical; Motivation; North America; Northern America; Philippines; Population; Population Dynamics; Psychological Factors; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; Southeastern Asia; United States; article; Asia; behavior; data analysis; decision making; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; developing country; International Migration; migration; Migration, Internal; motivation; North America; Northern America; Philippines; population; population dynamics; Psychological Factors; psychology; research; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; Southeast Asia; Southeastern Asia; theoretical model; United States; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01167960","","","12314292","English","Philipp Popul J","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022077803"

Recently, the National Urban Development Strategy (NUDS) project has generated a set of improved data. This paper aims at elaborating and supplementing the NUDS study. After a discussion of definitional problems, an analysis is carried out of urban growth rates at the provincial level. Private investment is shown to be a principal determinant of urban growth rates. Other significant determinants are rural immigration and the present level of urbanisation. Private investment is shown to be strongly biased towards provinces with large urban areas.

In the past few decades, Sierra Leone has continued to be characterized by a relatively small population size and low rate of growth. According to UN estimates, the population totaled 2.2 million in 1950 and increased to 2.5 and 2.8 million in 1960 and 1970, respectively. The rate of growth increased from 1.1% per annum during 1950-55 to 1.4% during 1970-75. The mortality rate declined only slightly, from 36.3 deaths per 1000 population during 1950-55 to a rate of around 35 in the following decades. The government of Sierra Leone does not have an explicit policy to modify population growth, even though in recent years the government has become more supportive of family planning activities, a major departure from its previous pronatalist policy. In 1978, improvements were made in data collection and data processing. The government first noted the relationship between a high rate of population growth and its negative effect on economic and social development in the 1973-74/1978-79 National Development Plan. Despite this recognition, no population policy was proposed. The total population size of Sierra Leone according to UN estimates was reported to be 3.3 million in 1980, an increase from 3 million in 1975. The population is projected to increase to 4.9 million by 2000, and the government considers the present rate of population growth to be too high. Sierra Leone continues to have high levels of morbidity and mortality. Latest UN estimates indicate a crude death rate of 31.9/1000 during the 1975-80 period, which the government considers, to be unacceptable. The government considers levels and trends of immigration to be not significant and satisfactory, although it did note in its 1974-75 development plan that the level of immigration was contributing to unemployment. The government regards the prevailing population distribution pattern to be inappropriate. Changes in the present pattern, would be desirable.","","Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Africa, Western; Birth Rate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Data Collection; Demography; Developing Countries; Disease; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Fertility; Geography; Morbidity; Mortality; Politics; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Public Policy; Research; Research Design; Sierra Leone; Social Planning; Africa; Africa South Of The Sahara; Birth Rate; Data Collection; Death Rate; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Development Planning; Diseases; Economic Factors; English Speaking Africa; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; Geographic Factors; International Migration; Macroeconomic Factors; Measurement; Migration; Morbidity; Mortality; Natural Resources; Policy; Political Factors; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Population Policy; Population Size; Research Methodology; Sierra Leone; Social Policy; Spatial Distribution; Western Africa; spatial distribution; Africa; Africa south of the Sahara; article; birth rate; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Development Planning; Diseases; Economic Factors; economics; English Speaking Africa; environmental protection; fertility; Fertility Measurements; general aspects of disease; Geographic Factors; geography; information processing; International Migration; Macroeconomic Factors; measurement; methodology; migration; morbidity; mortality; Natural Resources; policy; Political Factors; politics; population; population and population related phenomena; population density; population dynamics; population growth; Population Policy; population size; research; Research Methodology; Sierra Leone; Western Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","02596369","","","12314239","English","Popul Policy Compend","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022085099"

Famine requires explanation, the identification of indicators of its progress, and recognition of its demographic effects. Several studies have been conducted in the past few years, which have addressed 1 or more of these issues. In 1981 Sen developed a theoretical framework for the analysis of famine. He criticized the notion that famine results from a decline in food availability, arguing that famine often occurs without any overall major decline in food availability and that even when there are major declines in availability the causal mechanisms of starvation include many other variables. He suggested a more general framework, which involves the concept of food entitlements, i.e., the means by which individuals and families gain access to goods that provide for adequate diet of the relationship of people to food sources. Some of the relationships are simple, such as direct entitlements, and others are more complex, e.g., trade entitlements. Bongaarts and Cain suggest dependent entitlement as important in societies such as Bangladesh, where women are excluded from many agricultural activities and denied access to important forms of wage employment. The entitlement approach regards famines as economic disasters rather than food crises and the contrast between different forms of entitlement failure in different famines contributes to understanding the precise causation of famine and in developing policies for their anticipation, relief, and prevention. A 2nd major contribution to the understanding of famine was made by Alamgir (1980) who focused on the causality of famine and the identification of famine indicators, which would provide a forwarning system to enable national or international intervention at an early stage. The indicators identified were classified into groups to reflect the stage of the impending crisis. Hugo (1984) elaborated on the Bongaarts and Cain model, providing a typology of community and individual responses to famine, emphasizing particularly demographic responses. Hugo maintains that in recent famines in 3rd world nations evidence exists that permanent and temporary migration movements have been the most widespread and significant of contemporary adjustments to famine. The Karnataka study also provides support for the Bongaarts and Cain hypothesis that a famine-prone environment encourages high fertility. The data from China tend to support the Bongaarts and Cain model of demographic responses to famine.","","Asia; Behavior; Cause of Death; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Decision Making; Demography; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Environment; Europe; Far East; Fertility; Food Supply; Models, Theoretical; Mortality; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research; Socioeconomic Factors; Starvation; Statistics; Asia; Behavior; Carrying Capacity; Causes Of Death; China; Data Analysis; Decision Making; Demographic Analysis; Demographic Factors; Demographic Impact; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; Environment; Europe; Famine--determinants; Fertility; Food Supply; Literature Review; Macroeconomic Factors; Migration; Models, Theoretical; Mortality; Natural Resources; Population; Population At Risk; Population Dynamics; Population Theory; Research Methodology; Socioeconomic Factors; Southern Asia; article; Asia; behavior; Carrying Capacity; catering service; cause of death; Causes Of Death; China; data analysis; decision making; Demographic Factors; Demographic Impact; demography; developed country; developing country; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; economics; environment; environmental protection; Europe; Famine--determinants; Far East; fertility; Literature Review; Macroeconomic Factors; migration; mortality; Natural Resources; population; population and population related phenomena; Population At Risk; population dynamics; Population Theory; research; Research Methodology; socioeconomics; Southern Asia; starvation; theoretical model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00166987","","","12341508","English","Genus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0023166399"

A question on the Survival of the last child or of children born in the last year (unlike the more common questions on total number of live births, survival of all children born, or date of the last live birth or the number born in the last year) has not yet provided good results and is not recommended by the Latin American Demographic Center (CELADE) except in experimental censuses and demographic surveys. All countries should include a question on the ""year of arrival"" for foreign-born persons so that migration trends over time can be assessed. Some countries with incomplete vital statistics have omitted a question on whether the mother of each person in the household is living or not; this question has been very useful in estimating adult mortality. Although there has been great progress in including questions allowing study of population dynamics, there are disquieting indications of decline in the quality of data in some of the Latin American censuses taken in the 1980s. The content of questions in the census form or the order or manner in which they are included may lead to errors. Data users should participate in formulation of questions to ensure that the desired information is sought, and persons intimately familiar with local usage should participate to ensure that questions will be understood. An example of a poorly framed question occurred in the fertility section of the Argentinian census, where the 8th and subsequent births were lumped together in a precoded question, greatly limiting the usefulness of the data. The user should not have to skip from 1 place to another on the form; the inconvenience may lead to error or omission. The best order for questions is still a matter of study. In general questions pertaining to the entire universe should be followed by questions directed to specific subgroups, with clear instructions provided. The number of questions should be limited. Most countries include about 20. Precoding should be carefully planned to avoid loss of needed detail. All aspects of the census form should be subjected to careful evaluation in pilot and experimental censuses. There are indications that omission rates increased in the most recent census for 5 of the 9 countries whose 1970 and 1980 decade censuses were evaluated by CELADE. When nonresponse rates for particular questions become too high, the temptation to fill in the information using special problems should be avoided because of the danger of biasing the results. The original data should be preserved if assignments are made, and the criteria for assignment should be clear to the reader. The major risk of having a sample of households complete a more detailed census form is that the sample will not be representative. CELADE does not recommend post-census surveys because the amount of information they can impart does not justify their significant diversion of economic and manpower resources.","","Americas; Bias (Epidemiology); Caribbean Region; Censuses; Central America; Data Collection; Demography; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; English Abstract; Evaluation Studies; Latin America; North America; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Reproducibility of Results; Research; Research Design; Sampling Studies; Selection Bias; South America; Statistics; Vital Statistics; Demography; Emigration and Immigration; Fertility; Mortality; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research; Americas; Bias; Caribbean; Census; Census Methods; Central America; Data Adjustment; Data Analysis; Data Collection; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Error Sources; Estimation Technics; Evaluation; Evaluation Methodology; Latin America; Measurement; Microcensus; North America; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Statistics; Reliability; Research Methodology; Sampling Errors; Sampling Studies; South America; Studies; Undercount; Vital Statistics; Demographic Factors; Evaluation; Fertility; International Migration; Migration; Mortality; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Statistics; Research Methodology; bias; census; article; Census Methods; Central America; Data Adjustment; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; developing country; epidemiology; Error Sources; Estimation Technics; evaluation; Evaluation Methodology; information processing; measurement; methodology; Microcensus; North America; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; population research; Population Statistics; reliability; reproducibility; research; Research Methodology; Sampling Errors; South America; South and Central America; Studies; Undercount; vital statistics; Western Hemisphere; Demographic Factors; demography; evaluation; fertility; International Migration; migration; mortality; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; Population Statistics; research; Research Methodology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03031829","","","12314803","Spanish","Notas Poblacion","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022930871"

We show a positive return for the prospective population over the next few years, but for cohorts born after the end of the century returns will become sharply negative. A decline in returns is typical of pay-as-you-go schemes as they mature, and a change to negative returns is typical in particular as the birth rate falls under fixed economic conditions. The return can be kept positive by greatly increased fertility or immigration. Taking labour-force participation rates into account, and supposing entitlement independent of contribution, gives much larger negative rates of return, however. The main calculations considered here are for schemes with a constant pension. If the contribution rather than the pension is kept constant then the disparities between cohorts with respect to their returns are smaller, and although the negative returns for future generations then set in earlier they are smaller. The conclusions of the paper are broadly applicable to any population that showed a baby boom after World War II and replacement-level or lower fertility subsequently. © 1985 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.","","Americas; Birth Rate; Demography; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Fertility; Financial Management; Financing, Government; Forecasting; Health Manpower; Health Planning; Health Resources; North America; Organization and Administration; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Research Design; Social Security; Statistics; United States; Americas; Birth Rate; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Estimation Technics; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; Financial Activities; Financing, Government; Human Resources; Labor Force; Macroeconomic Factors; Management; Measurement; Migration; North America; Northern America; Organization And Administration; Planning; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Projection; Research Methodology; Resources; Social Security; United States; article; birth rate; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; developing country; Economic Factors; economics; employment; Estimation Technics; fertility; Fertility Measurements; Financial Activities; financial management; forecasting; health care manpower; health care planning; Human Resources; Labor Force; Macroeconomic Factors; management; measurement; methodology; migration; North America; Northern America; organization and management; planning; population; population dynamics; Population Projection; research; Research Methodology; Resources; social security; United States; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","Boskin M., The crisis in social security, (1977); Campbell C., Financing social security, (1979); Clark R., Retirement policy in an aging society, (1980); Hurd M.D., Shoven J.B., The distributional impact of social security, (1983); Rosa J., The world crisis in social security, (1982); Samuelson P.A., An exact consumption-loan model of interest with or without the social contrivance of money, The Journal of Political Economy, 68, pp. 467-482, (1958); Stein B., Social security and pensions in transition, (1980); Demographic indices of countries — Estimates and projections as assessed in 1980, ST/ESA/SER.A 1982, (1982)","","","Kluwer Academic Publishers","","","","","","15729885","","","12159013","English","Eur J Population","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022267670"

Data for the study was derived from the 1979 migration survey of a sample of 58,000 rural and urban households, conducted by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics. Data on nonmigrants at the migrants' place of origin was derived from 1976 census materials. Only male migrants who were employed both at their place of origin and destination were included in the analysis. Percent distributions were used to analyze the data. Analysis of the migrants' demogrpahic characteristics indicated that the migrants tended to be relatively young and that the rural to urban migrants were younger than the urban to urban migrants. Appoximately 2/5 of the migrants were single at the time of migration, and the marital status of both migrant groups was similar. The migrants tended to be more educated than the nonmigrants at the migrants' place of origin, and there was a tendency for the migrants to increase their educational status after arriving in their place of destination. The migrants experienced more upward occupational mobility than nonmigrant males at the migrants' place of origin. Although the urban to urban migrants tended to have higher occupational status both at the place of origin and destination than rural to urban migrants, rural to urban migrants experienced more upward occupation mobility after migrating than urban to urban migrants. Changes in migrant occupational status after migration were explained primarily by age, educational status, duration of current residence, and a rural to urban backgroud. Following migration, urban to urban migrants achieved greater increases in monthly income than rural to urban migrants. This pattern persisted even when age, education, and duration of residence at the place of destination were controlled.

The finding of a strong positive association between breastfeeding and the length of postpartum amenorrhea is as expected from numerous other studies.

Several characteristics of the migrant population were found from the data analysis. The biggest proportion of migrants was in 20-24 age group. This age group sent 26.1% of the migrants to metro-cities, 27.6% to large cities, 25.1% to median sized cities, 22.4% to small cities, and 22.2% to towns. Migrants in the 15-29 age groups accounted for 50% of the migrants to different-sized cities and towns. Female migration is 4.2-15.4% lower than male. The proportion migrating because of marriage ranged between 84/7-92.5% to different-sized cities for females, which is much higher than for males. The level of education in the migrant population is higher than in the general population, as educational qualifications are important for job opportunities. Those with middle school and above education, make up the bulk of the migrants, and 30-40% of the migrant population to big cities increased their educational level after migrating. The currently and never married comprise, the majority of the migrant population, while the number of widowed and divorced is minimal (2 and 0.4%, respectively). Most of the widowed were 60 years old and migrated for subsistence to cities where their children lived. Among the unmarried migrants, female make up 1/3. Whereas among the married, there are more females than males.","","Age Factors; Asia; China; Data Collection; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Educational Status; Emigration and Immigration; English Abstract; Far East; Marital Status; Marriage; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research; Residential Mobility; Sampling Studies; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Transients and Migrants; Age Factors; Asia; China; Demographic Factors; Demographic Surveys; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; Educational Status; Marital Status; Migrants; Migration; Migration, Internal; Nuptiality; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; Sampling Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Studies; Surveys; nuptiality; age; article; Asia; China; Demographic Factors; Demographic Surveys; demography; developing country; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; economics; epidemiology; Far East; information processing; marriage; Migrants; migration; Migration, Internal; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; social class; social status; socioeconomics; Studies; Surveys","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10006087","","","12159324","Chinese","Renkou Yanjiu","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024045122"

In addition, the marital status at immigration and the nationality of the woman also show a particular correlation with the fertility.

Fertility was basically the same between migrant and nonmigrant women in their early reproductive years, but clear differences existed between older migrants and nonmigrants as indicated by children ever born (CEB). In fact, migration did not significantly affect cumulative fertility at all (correlation ratio=.03). Moreover its effect was further reduced when the researchers controlled for age and duration of marriage. Besides level of education and contraceptive use status contributed more to explanations of fertility differentials (correlation ratio=.09 for both) than did migration. The mean number of CEB adjusted for all variables fell with level of education from 4.18 for those with primary education to 3.63 to those with college education. This result identified education as a means to reduce high fertility in the Philippines. On the other hand, the mean was higher among women who ever used contraception than it was for those who never used it (4.21 vs. 3.72). Apparently considerable family size motivated mothers to use contraception. Since women who migrated to cities tended to be in the beginning of their reproductive period, considerable natural increase could occur in urban areas. Therefore the Philippines needed to devise a strategy for reducing fertility among migrant women as well as strategies for other groups such as professional/career oriented women and women who remained at home to tend to children and/or the home.","","Age Factors; Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Comparative Study; Contraception; Contraception Behavior; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Educational Status; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Family Characteristics; Family Planning; Fertility; Marriage; Methods; Multivariate Analysis; Organization and Administration; Philippines; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research; Residential Mobility; Sex Behavior; Social Class; Social Mobility; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; Age Factors; Asia; Comparative Studies; Contraception; Contraceptive Usage; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Demographic Surveys; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Educational Status--women; Employment--women; Family And Household; Family Characteristics; Family Planning; Family Size; Family Size, Completed; Fertility; Macroeconomic Factors; Marriage; Marriage Duration; Methodological Studies; Migrants--women; Migration; Multiple Classification Analysis; Multivariate Analysis; Nonmigrants--women; Nuptiality; Obstacles; Organization And Administration; Origin; Philippines; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Reproductive Behavior; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; Social Class; Social Mobility; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Southeastern Asia; Studies; nuptiality; age; article; Asia; Comparative Studies; comparative study; contraception; Contraceptive Usage; data analysis; Demographic Factors; Demographic Surveys; demography; developing country; Economic Factors; economics; Educational Status--women; employment; Employment--women; Family And Household; family planning; family size; Family Size, Completed; fertility; Macroeconomic Factors; marriage; Marriage Duration; Methodological Studies; Migrants--women; migration; Multiple Classification Analysis; multivariate analysis; Nonmigrants--women; Obstacles; organization and management; Origin; Philippines; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; sexual behavior; social class; social status; socioeconomics; Southeast Asia; Southeastern Asia; Studies; technique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01167960","","","12317187","English","Philipp Popul J","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0023670710"

This assessment is taken from the World Population Prospects: Estimates and Projections as Assessed in 1982 and Estimates and Projections of Urban, Rural, and City Populations, 1950-2025: The 1982 Assessment. The current rate of population growth of 1.7% per year is still high in a historical perspective but is lower than the peak rate of 2% that prevailed in the late 1960s; this slowdown is largely due to the deceleration of population growth in the developed countries and in China. For the world as a whole, it is projected that the growth rate will slowly decline to about 1.5% by the year 2000 and to slightly less than 1% by 2025. The annual rate of growth, however, is .6% on the average for the more developed regions, while it is 2% in the less developed regions. The most rapidly growing region is Africa, and the slowest growing region is Europe. The 25 most populous countries in 1984 and 2025, the 20 countries with the lowest and highest growth rates, and the percentage of distribution by region, 1950, 1980, and 2025 are given. While the median age of the populations of Europe and the Soviet Union increased by about 4 years between 1950 and 1980, the median age decreased by 1.6 years in Africa. However, the median age of the world population is expected to increase from 22.4 years in 1980 to 26.4 years in 2000, and to 31 years in 2025. The estimates and projections from the 1982 assessment show steady declines from 1950 to 2025 in the crude birth rate and gross reproduction rate for all major regions of the world except Northern America and Europe, for which fertility is projected to increase slightly in the future. In addition, life expectancy at birth increased from 45.8 years in 1950-1955 to 57.3 years in 1975-1980; the largest gains in mortality decline were achieved by the less developed regions. Slightly more than half of the world's expected population of 6.1 billion by the year 2000 will be residing in urban areas. For most countries, net migration is relatively small and in the preparation of estimates and projections at the national level it is usually assumed to be zero; however, the 25 receiving countries are generally the more developed countries.","","Age Distribution; Age Factors; Demography; Emigration and Immigration; Forecasting; Life Expectancy; Longevity; Mortality; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Research; Statistics; Urban Population; Urbanization; Age Distribution; Age Factors; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Estimation Technics; Length Of Life; Life Expectancy; Migration; Mortality; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Population Projection; Population Size; Population Statistics; Research Methodology; Spatial Distribution; Urban Spatial Distribution; Urbanization; World; spatial distribution; age; age distribution; article; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; Estimation Technics; forecasting; Length Of Life; life expectancy; longevity; migration; mortality; population; population and population related phenomena; population density; population dynamics; population growth; Population Projection; population size; Population Statistics; research; Research Methodology; urban population; Urban Spatial Distribution; urbanization; World","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00484849","","","12179620","English","Popul Newsl","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022088593"

The estimated prevalence of malnutrition (calculated as less than 80% of the reference weight for height) ranged from 32% to 52% among children of preschool age. The principal causes of morbidity and mortality were measles, diarrhoea and dysentery. resoiratory infections, and malaria.

These projections are the 1st to be produced by single years of age for individual calendar years. They are also the 1st to use an enhanced methodology that incorporates the annual state-to-state flows of migrants from matched tax returns together with the demographic detail from the Current Population Survey and decennial census. Some highlights of the data follow. 1) The South and West will continue to be the fastest growing regions in the US. By 2010, the South will still be the most populous region, increasing its share of the total population to over 37%, while the West will become the 2nd most populous region with over 23% of the population. 21% of the population will reside in the Midwest, while about 19% will reside in the Northeast. 2) California is projected to remain the most populous state for the next 25 years, followed by New York (until 1990, when Texas pushes it to 3rd), Florida, and Illinois (by the year 2000). 3) Of the 4 regions in 1986 and 1990, the Northeast will have the highest proportion of its population in the 65 or over age group. It will also have the lowest proportion in the younger groups, under 5 and 5-17. The West will have a higher proportion of its population in the youngest age group and a lower proportion in the oldest group. 4) During the last decade of this century, the numbers of children under age 5 are projected to decline by 1.5 million, while the numbers of school-age children will increase by over 3 million. By 2000, the Northeast will still have the oldest age distribution, while the West will continue to have the youngest. 5) Between 2000 and 2010, the numbers of children under age 5 are projected to remain constant in the US, while declining in the Northeast and Midwest and increasing in the South and West. By 2010, the Northeast, Midwest, and South all will have approximately 14% of the population in the oldest age group. 6) By 2010, the median age of the Northeast region is projected to reach 40.3. The South will become the 2nd oldest region with a median age of 39.4 years, and Utah will be the only state with a median age less than 30 years (27.6). 7) By 2010, the nation's black population is projected to number almost 39 million, an increase of over 12 million since 1980. The white population will be almost 229 million.","","Age Factors; Americas; Blacks; Culture; Data Collection; Demography; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Groups; Forecasting; Geography; Government Publications; North America; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Research; Residential Mobility; Sex Factors; Statistics; Transients and Migrants; United States; Whites; Age Factors; Americas; Blacks; Cultural Background; Data Analysis; Data Collection; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Estimation Technics; Ethnic Groups; Geographic Factors; Government Publication; International Migration; Migrants; Migration; Migration, Internal; North America; Northern America; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Growth Estimation; Population Projection; Population Statistics; Population--changes; Research Methodology; Sex Factors; Spatial Distribution; Tables And Charts; United States; Whites; spatial distribution; age; article; Caucasian; cultural anthropology; Cultural Background; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; developing country; Estimation Technics; ethnic group; forecasting; Geographic Factors; geography; Government Publication; information processing; International Migration; Migrants; migration; Migration, Internal; negro; North America; Northern America; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; population growth; Population Growth Estimation; Population Projection; Population Statistics; Population--changes; research; Research Methodology; sex difference; Tables And Charts; United States; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0738453X","","","12281760","English","Curr Popul Rep Popul Estim Proj","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024093191"

Southeast Togo is discussed. A survey questionnaire was prepared and adminstered to the sample population in 5 villages. 75 male migrants and 25 female migrants were interviewed. They had been forced out of Nigeria and were over 15 years of age; women whose husbands had been interviewed were excluded. Data collection began in August of 1983. The study is not purported to be representative of all those forced to leave Nigeria, but simply has allowed quantitative analysis concepts to be applied. It was hypothesized that the extent of male migration was more important than that of females. The Apple II and IBM PC computers were used. It is concluded that the key to greater demographic stability lies in the general improvement of the economic and social situation. Rural development should be the focus of attention. Improving the quality of life and the progress of knowledge are determing factors of development. Agriculture represents an economic potential that may increase income and contribute to the well being of people. In the Southeast poor rain conditions can be dealt with by irrigation methods. A diversification of activities in rural areas is hoped for. Population studies are indispensible in order to obtain a clear concept of the functioning of societies. An optimist, active approach is urged.","","Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Africa, Northern; Africa, Western; Agriculture; Automatic Data Processing; Climate; Computers; Data Collection; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; English Abstract; Evaluation Studies; Health Services Needs and Demand; Income; Nigeria; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Quality of Life; Refugees; Research; Rural Population; Sampling Studies; Social Welfare; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Togo; Transients and Migrants; Africa; Africa South Of The Sahara; Agriculture; Climate; Computers; Data Analysis; Data Collection; Demographic Factors; Demographic Surveys; Developing Countries; Economic Conditions; Economic Factors; English Speaking Africa; Evaluation; French Speaking Africa; Income; Information Processing; Macroeconomic Factors; Migrants; Migration; Needs; Nigeria; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Quality Of Life; Quantitative Evaluation; Refugees; Research Methodology; Research Report; Rural Population; Sampling Studies; Social Welfare; Socioeconomic Factors; Studies; Surveys; Togo; Western Africa; Africa; Africa south of the Sahara; agriculture; article; climate; computer; data analysis; Demographic Factors; Demographic Surveys; demography; developing country; Economic Conditions; Economic Factors; economics; English Speaking Africa; epidemiology; evaluation; French Speaking Africa; health service; income; information processing; Macroeconomic Factors; Migrants; migration; Needs; Nigeria; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; quality of life; Quantitative Evaluation; refugee; research; Research Methodology; Research Report; rural population; social welfare; socioeconomics; Studies; Surveys; Togo; Western Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10155554","","","12267414","French","Etud Togol Popul","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022224406"

The overall objective of the Latin American Regional Population Program is to assist countries in the knowledge of their demographic situation and in the formulation and evaluation of development plans and programs in the field of population by creating the capacities, knowledge, and inputs necessary for this purpose. Activities in the 1984-87 period will be grouped into 5 subprograms: demographic statistics and estimation of population trends, population and development, teaching and training, population documentation and demographic dataprocessing, and publications. The demographic effects of family planning programs will be evaluated, and assistance will be provided for studies on fertility differentials, infant mortality, and internal and international migration. Most of the projected activities cover fields of work that individual countries are unable to undertake by themselves, either for reasons of cost and specialization of human resources or because they transcent the national scope.","","Americas; Automatic Data Processing; Caribbean Region; Communication; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Education; Health Planning; Information Services; International Agencies; Latin America; North America; Organization and Administration; Organizations; Population Control; Public Policy; Research; South America; Teaching; United Nations; Americas; Caribbean; Celade; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Education; Iec; Information; Information Distribution; Information Processing; International Agencies; Latin America; North America; Organization And Administration; Organizations; Policy; Population Control; Population Policy; Population Programs; Program Activities; Programs; Research Methodology; Social Policy; South America; Training Activities; Training Programs; Un; article; Celade; Central America; developed country; developing country; education; health care planning; Iec; information; Information Distribution; information processing; information service; international cooperation; interpersonal communication; North America; organization; organization and management; policy; population dynamics; Population Policy; Population Programs; Program Activities; Programs; research; Research Methodology; South America; South and Central America; teaching; Training Activities; Training Programs; Un; United Nations; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03031829","","","12266325","English","Notas Poblacion","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021404206"

The model shares many common traits with other computable general equilibrium (CGE) simulation models, and its underlying framework is neoclassical. The model stresses spatial issues so that it can provide predictions on rural/urban labor demands, and hence on migration flows. The central issue we seek to evaluate is whether a neoclassical development paradigm can explain adequately the somewhat paradoxical patterns of urbanization and economic growth observed in India since 1960. Our conclusion is a qualified, affirmative response, based on the model's ability to replicate key macroeconomic variables."" excerpt","","Asia; Automatic Data Processing; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Geography; India; Models, Economic; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Residential Mobility; Software; Urban Population; Urbanization; Asia; Computer Programs And Programming; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Development; Economic Factors; Economic Model; Geographic Factors; India; Information; Information Processing; Macroeconomic Factors; Migration; Migration, Internal; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; Southern Asia; Spatial Distribution; Urban Spatial Distribution; Urbanization; spatial distribution; article; Asia; computer program; Computer Programs And Programming; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; economic development; Economic Factors; Economic Model; economics; Geographic Factors; geography; India; information; information processing; Macroeconomic Factors; migration; Migration, Internal; population; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; Southern Asia; statistical model; theoretical model; urban population; Urban Spatial Distribution; urbanization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","09701532","","","12268830","English","Indian J Quant Econ","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022939668"

Ever since the 1st Comprehensive National Development Plan in 1962, basic objectives of the plans have been well-balanced development of national land, adjustment of regional disparities, and dissolution of overcongestion and depopulation. Japan experienced rapid urbanization in the period from the war reconstruction of the 1940s through the high economic growth of the 1950s and 1960s. Particularly, during the high economic growth of the 1960s, the concentration of population and industry was extremely notable in the 3 metropolitan regions centering around Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya. There are indications of increases in excess migration to metropolitan regions once again, but this is due to increases of migration only to the Tokyo Metropolitan Regions. No such indications are seen for the Nagoya and Osaka Metropolitan Regions. Tokyo Metropolitan Regions are changing more and more, as a important international center of banking and information in the world; on the other hand, Osaka is lessening its sphere of influence. Particularly, from the 1980s, the concentration of population and nucleus functional institutions is extremely notable in the Tokyo Metropolitan Regions. The main objective of this paper is to analyze Tokyo New Industrial Cities, and other depopulated areas, through the distribution of population and the location of industry. author's modified","","Asia; Demography; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Far East; Geography; Japan; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Residential Mobility; Social Planning; Statistics; Urban Population; Asia; Data Analysis; Demographic Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Development Planning; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; Geographic Factors; Japan; Macroeconomic Factors; Migration; Migration, Internal; Multiregional Analysis; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Spatial Distribution; Urban Spatial Distribution; spatial distribution; article; Asia; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; developing country; Development Planning; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; economics; Far East; Geographic Factors; geography; Japan; Macroeconomic Factors; migration; Migration, Internal; Multiregional Analysis; policy; population; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; urban population; Urban Spatial Distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03872793","","","12314928","English","Jinko Mondai Kenkyu","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0023326182"

Regression equations were estimated to determine the effect of legal status on wages independent of other demographic, social and economic variables, and special efforts were made to control for possible sample selection biases. Findings suggest that the data are relatively free from selectivity problems that have characterized earlier studies, and that legal status had no direct effect on wage rates earned by male migrants from the four communities. Legal status also had little effect on the kind of job that migrants take in the United States, but it does play an important indirect role in determining the length of time that migrants stay in that country. By reducing the duration of stay, illegal status lowers the amount of employer-specific capital accruing to undocumented migrants, and thereby lowers wage rates relative to legal migrants.""

In the past 2 decades, the Hong Kong Government has prepared 5 sets of projections on population size and structure. This article examines the accuracy of each of these projections and the formulation of their underlying assumptions. For example, recent projections have recognized the fact that women in different age groups exhibit different fertility patterns. The projection of the birth order-specific fertility rates also has been adopted, with the net reproduction rate used to check accuracy. In formulating mortality trends, standardized sex-cause-specific death rates for broad age groups were first projected into the future and then summed over various causes to derive the projected age-sex-specific death rates. Migration remains the most difficult component to forecast, and is the main source of error. Projections prepared in 1961 and 1971 (for 1971 and 1976) turned out to be far above actual population levels, whereas the 1976-based projections (for 1984) were overly conservative. The most recent set of projections, covering the period 1981-2001, was based on reasonably good assumptions. The population size is projected to grow from 5.13 million in 1981 to almost 7.11 million in 2001. The sex ratio will be 1074 males:1000 females. The rates of population growth is expected to decrease from 2.1%/year in the early 1980s to just over 1% in 2001. In terms of the age structure, the proportion aged 65 years and over is projected to increase from 7% in 1981 to 10% in 2001; the dependency ratio, however, is expected to decrease from 456/1000 to 444/1000.","","Asia; Demography; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Far East; Fertility; Forecasting; Hong Kong; Mortality; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Statistics; Asia; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Estimation Technics; Fertility; Hong Kong; Migration; Mortality; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Projection; Research Methodology; article; Asia; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Eastern Asia; Estimation Technics; Far East; fertility; forecasting; Hong Kong; migration; mortality; population; population dynamics; Population Projection; research; Research Methodology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","05376998","","","12222501","English","Ingu munje nonjip","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022089710"

Occupation of household head was taken as a measure of socioeconomic status. Total fertility rates were analysed for three periods: pre-famine, famine and post-famine. Overall fertility declined due to the famine by 34%, but this was compensated partially by a 17% increase in the post-famine period. Fertility of women of all ages and socioeconomic groups was affected by the famine, a more pronounced effect being observed among the poor. Fertility showed a higher post-famine recovery among women in the middle socioeconomic groups and in those aged 25–34 years. © 1988, Cambridge University Press.

Data are drawn from Current Population Reports. 1) The January 1, 1988 total population including Armed Forces overseas was over 245 million. This reflects a .9% increase over January 1, 1987, and an increase of 18 million since the April 1, 1980 census. 2) In the beginning of 1988, Whites numbered 206,979 million, Blacks 30,083, and Blacks and other races 38,130. 3) The crude birth rate dipped from 15.9 in 1980 to 15.6 in 1987; there is no evidence of a consistent trend since 1980. 4) The 3.8 million births in 1987 reflect a continuation of the gradual increase births that has been occurring since the mid-1970s, an increase attributed to Baby Boomers. 5) There was an 8.7/1000 death rate in 1987. This rate has fluctuated in the 8.5-8.7/1000 range since 1977 after declining from 9.4/1000 in 1972. The 2.1 million deaths in 1987 continue the gradual increase that has occurred since the end of the 1940s. This increase is attributed to the growth in population and to the population's continued aging. 6) Net immigrants/1000 population dropped slightly to 2.5 in 1987, down from 2.7 in 1986 and 3.7 in 1980. 7) Rates of growth for both Blacks and Whites have declined substantially since 1960; Blacks declined by about 1/3 (from 2.2%) and Whites by more than 1/2 (from 1.5%). The population of other races increased by 4.5% in 1987. The Black population grew by 1.5% in 1987, compared with a growth of .7% for the White population.","","Americas; Birth Rate; Blacks; Data Collection; Demography; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Groups; Government Publications; Mortality; North America; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Research; Statistics; United States; Whites; Americas; Birth Rate; Blacks; Data Analysis; Data Collection; Death Rate; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Estimation Technics; Ethnic Groups; Fertility Measurements; Fertility Rate; Government Publication; International Migration; Migration; Mortality; North America; Northern America; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Growth Estimation; Population Growth--changes; Population Statistics; Research Methodology; Tables And Charts; United States; Whites; reproduction rate; article; birth rate; Caucasian; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; developing country; Estimation Technics; ethnic group; Fertility Measurements; Government Publication; information processing; International Migration; migration; mortality; negro; North America; Northern America; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; population growth; Population Growth Estimation; Population Growth--changes; Population Statistics; research; Research Methodology; Tables And Charts; United States; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0738453X","","","12342037","English","Curr Popul Rep Popul Estim Proj","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024057844"

In the few studies which include climate variables in models used to explain migration, the treatment accorded to climate as an explanatory variable has not been satisfactory. This paper attempts to fill this void. Our paper first critically reviews the treatment of climate in the migration literature and then proposes alternative ways of dealing with it which represent improvements from both a theoretical and an empirical point of view. Our regression results suggest that individuals do indeed consider climatic conditions in different areas when deciding where to live. Our results also indicate that the climate variables which yield the best results are generally those which have not been used in the literature. © 1983 Annals of Regional Science.","","Americas; Demography; Developed Countries; Ecology; Emigration and Immigration; Environment; Models, Economic; Models, Theoretical; North America; Population; Population Dynamics; Regression Analysis; Research; Residential Mobility; Statistics; United States; Urban Population; Americas; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Ecology; Economic Model; Environment; Literature Review; Mathematical Model; Migration; Migration, Internal; Models, Theoretical; North America; Northern America; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Statistical Regression; Statistical Studies; United States; Urban Population; article; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; ecology; Economic Model; environment; Literature Review; mathematical model; migration; Migration, Internal; North America; Northern America; population; population dynamics; regression analysis; research; Research Methodology; statistical model; Statistical Regression; Statistical Studies; theoretical model; United States; urban population; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","Alperovich G., Bergsman J., Ehemann C., An Econometric Model of Migration Between US Metropolitan Areas, Urban Studies, June, pp. 135-145, (1977); Cebula R.J., Vedder R.K., A Note on Migration, Economic Opportunity, and the Quality of Life, Journal of Regional Science, April, pp. 205-211, (1973); Graves P.E., A Reexamination of Migration, Economic Opportunity, and the Quality of Life, Journal of Regional Science, April, pp. 107-112, (1976); Graves P.E., Income and Migration Revisited, Journal of Human Resources, Winter, pp. 112-121, (1979); Graves P.E., A Life-Cycle Empirical Analysis of Migration and Climate, by Race, Journal of Urban Economics, April, pp. 135-147, (1979); Greenwood M.J., An Analysis of the Determinants of Geographic Labor Mobility in the United States, Review of Economics and Statistics, May, pp. 189-194, (1969); Greenwood M.J., Research on Internal Migration in the United States: A Survey, Journal of Economic Literature, July, pp. 397-433, (1975); Kau J.B., Sirmans C.F., The Influence of Information Cost and Uncertainty on Migration: A Comparison of Migrant Types, Journal of Regional Science, April, pp. 89-96, (1977); Kau J.B., Sirmans C.F., A Recursive Model of the Spatial Allocation of Migrants, Journal of Regional Science, February, pp. 47-56, (1979); Miller E., Is Out-Migration Affected by Economic Conditions, Southern Economic Journal, January, pp. 396-405, (1973); Pack J.R., Determinants of Migration to Central Cities, Journal of Regional Science, August, pp. 249-260, (1973); Pursell D.E., Age and Educational Dimensions in Southern Migration Patterns, 1965–1970, Southern Economic Journal, July, pp. 148-154, (1977); Renas S.M., An Empirical Note on the Tiebout-Tullock Hypothesis: Comment, Quarterly Journal of Economics, May, pp. 319-623, (1980); Renas S.M., Kumar R., The Cost of Living, Labor Opportunities, and the Migration Decision: A Case of Misspecification?: Reply, Annals of Regional Science, November, pp. 106-108, (1979)","","","Springer-Verlag","","","","","","14320592","","","12265290","English","Ann Reg Sci","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0020647639"

The population register provides legal identification for the individual and records his movements from 1 civil subdivision to another. The process of establishing a population register is not a simple one. All 5 of these records are incomplete, defective, and in most cases decentralized; yet, in spite of these limitations, administrative records are potential sources of migration data. Because of their imcompleteness, major biases are likely to arise in their use. The 1st step is for National Statistical Services to assist in improving the coverage of events expected to be registered in any of these records. The 2nd step is to try to use the data through some form of ratio of regression estimation.

As a result the provision of health care for migrants has become a national priority in many countries 'in development'. Information describing the extent to which traditional medical beliefs and practices persist is crucial to the formation of systems of health care for migrant communities. This paper describes the dynamics of medical conservatism. Data analysis obtained from a comparative study of 52 Peruvian women living in a rural highland province and 50 Peruvian women from a migrant squatter settlement, a barriada, indicates that length of exposure to an urban environment is less of a determinant in medical conservatism than age of enculturation. Positive and negative implications of medical conservatism for the delivery of health services are discussed. Recommendations are suggested for greater emphasis on the coordination of programs of health care with community education. © 1983.","","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Comparative Study; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Genital Diseases, Female; Health Education; Health Services, Indigenous; Human; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Age; Midwifery; Peru; Phytotherapy; Postnatal Care; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Rural Health; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Transients and Migrants; Urban Health; adolescent; adult; article; child; comparative study; female; gynecologic disease; health; health care delivery; health education; health service; human; midwife; migration; Peru; phytotherapy; postnatal care; pregnancy; psychological aspect; questionnaire; traditional medicine","","","","","Regent’s Fund; Tinker Foundation, TFI; University of California, Los Angeles, UCLA","*This project was made possible through the financial support of the Tinker Foundation and the Regent’s Fund (UCLA).

Special attention is paid to the continuing albeit reduced impact of infanticide. Brief comparisons with other Melanesian and Third World societies are presented; the Asmat average annual growth rate of 1.5% since first permanent contact in 1953 contrasts with the generally higher rates reported for most of these other groups. © 1978 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","Asmat;

Cinq types d'exurbains ont été identifiés parmi deux courants principaux d'exurbanisation: le premier serait une phase tardive d'urbanisation, une continuation de l'étalement urbain; le deuxième en serait plutǒt un d'anti‐urbanisation, relié au processus de changement dans les valeurs de notre société. From a survey of 280 exurbanites in the Eastern Townships, Québec, it was found that Montrealers made up one‐third of the sample. Distance from the city did not seem to be a hindrance to them, since they preferred isolated situations, whereas the local exurbanites were concentrated around their regional towns. Five types of exurbanites were identified among two main trends of exurbanization: the first is a late phase of urbanization, in which urban sprawl is continued; the second is part of a counter‐urbanization process related to cultural change.

Some relevant methodological issues are presented here in a time series study using aggregate data. The micro-macro distinction is relative. Time enters into the micro and macro variables in different ways. A simple micro model of rural-urban migration is given. Method 1 is to assume homogeneity in behavior. Method 2 is a Bayesian estimation. A discusssion of the results follows. Time series models of aggregate data are given. The nature of the model--predictive or explanatory--must be decided on. Explanatory models in longitudinal studies have been developed. Ways to go to the micro level from the macro are discussed. The aggregation-disaggregation problem in demography is not similar to that in econometrics. To understand small populations, separate micro level data have to be collected and analyzed and appropriate models developed. Both types of models have their uses.","","Comparative Study; Demography; Longitudinal Studies; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Dynamics; Probability; Reproducibility of Results; Research; Research Design; Residential Mobility; Social Sciences; Statistics; Time Factors; Comparative Studies; Data Analysis; Demographic Analysis; Demographic Factors; Demographic Surveys; Demography; Error Sources; Longitudinal Studies; Mathematical Model; Measurement; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Dynamics; Probability; Reliability; Research Methodology; Research Report; Rural-urban Migration; Social Sciences; Studies; Time Factors; article; Comparative Studies; comparative study; data analysis; Demographic Factors; Demographic Surveys; demography; Error Sources; longitudinal study; mathematical model; measurement; methodology; migration; population; population dynamics; probability; reliability; reproducibility; research; Research Methodology; Research Report; Rural-urban Migration; sociology; Studies; theoretical model; time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00166987","","","12266013","English","Genus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0020235459"

China uses the standard fertility rate method, using fertility rates based on family planning standards to make projections. This unique method 1) calculates children per couple's lifetime, 2) uses generally only the lower numerical values, and 3) acknowledges that the change to new standards will produce a gradual change (although new standards could also bring about a sudden and dramatic fall in fertility). Actual fertility rates result from spontaneous childbearing; standard fertility rates result from planned population control. Researchers calculate projected deaths using age specific survival estimation and projected births and infant mortality rates. Migration, which may influence birth and death rates, should be considered especially for large cities and emerging industrial areas. 3 essential conditions for population projection exist: 1) using mathematical models to express quantitative relationships between present and future populations, 2) determining exact future numerical values for the relationships, using socio-economic conditions, and 3) acquiring statistical data on the present population. Previous population projections have been a passive estimation--estimation without control. Recent projections estimate the possible result of present family planning policies, and aid in controlling population growth. This method--projection with control-- shows what population will be like given certain goals and policies. It considers the number of children each couple will have in a lifetime, not age-specific fertility rates. Distribution of marriage ages, dates of first births after marriage, intervals between first and second births, and proportion of 1-child families must be known. Short-term population projections (5-10 years) are comparatively accurate, and can be used for drafting 5 year plans. Long-term projections (30-50 years) reveal long-term trends, but must be periodically revised. As its main purpose, population projection uses proportional relationships to interpret the causality of phenomena, their numerical values, and to estimate future socio-economic conditions and their influence on population.","","Asia; Birth Rate; China; Demography; Developing Countries; Evaluation Studies; Far East; Fertility; Forecasting; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Research Design; Statistics; Asia; Birth Rate; China; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Estimation Technics; Evaluation; Evaluation Methodology; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; Fertility Rate; Measurement; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Projection; Research Methodology; reproduction rate; article; Asia; birth rate; China; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Eastern Asia; Estimation Technics; evaluation; Evaluation Methodology; Far East; fertility; Fertility Measurements; forecasting; measurement; methodology; population; population dynamics; Population Projection; research; Research Methodology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10026576","","","12313975","English","Popul Res","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0020864464"

These estimation technics can be used to assess migration flows in countries where migration data is not available. Census data which can be used to analysis migration patterns include age and sex distributions, foreign residence of relatives, birthplace, nationality, residence at some specific time in the past, and lenght of residence. The relative value and reliability of these different types of census data examining migration were discussed. Census infromation an age and sex distributions of the population is very useful because selective migration will be revealed by distortions in the distribution. An examination of the 1970 age and sex distribution for Kuwait revealed that the sex ratios, number of males to females, were higher than expected for ages 10-59. Subtraction of the number of females, aged 10-59, in the population from the number of males, aged 10-59, indicated that there was an excess of 97,359 males. This figure represented the estimated number of surviving male immigrants in the 1970 Kuwait population. This estimate was further refined by comparing the 1970 age and sex distribution with a stable population distribution. The comparison revealed that the 1st estimate of male immigration was probably too low, and that female immigration was also a factor. Another technic can be used if data from 2 censuses are available. The data from the 1st census can be used to project the age and sex distribution of the 2nd census. Then the projected distribution can be compared to the actual distribution observed in the 2nd census. Differences between the observed and projected censuses will serve to identify distortions in the distribution of the 2nd census. Errors in age reporting and differences in census data collecting procedures may bias the results of the analysis. This technic was applied to Kuwait census data on males only for 1965 and 1970. The estimated number of surviving male immigrants in the population in 1970, derived by applying this technic, was 70,598. Estimates of immigration were considerably different when age and sex distribution and place of birth were used jointly to estimate the size of the immigrant group. The estimated number of female immigrants was 106,000, and the estimated number of male immigrants was 200,000. When information on duration of residence was added to the other information, it was possible to estimate immigration by time periods. Several other technics were discussed and suggestions for altering were provided.","","Age Distribution; Age Factors; Asia; Asia, Western; Censuses; Culture; Data Collection; Demography; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Groups; Forecasting; Interpersonal Relations; Kuwait; Middle East; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research; Research Design; Residence Characteristics; Residential Mobility; Sex Distribution; Sex Factors; Statistics; Time Factors; Transients and Migrants; Age Distribution; Age Factors; Age Reporting; Arab Countries; Asia; Census; Census Methods; Cultural Background; Data Analysis; Data Collection; Data Reporting; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Estimation Technics; Ethnic Groups; Friends And Relatives; International Migration; Kuwait; Migrants; Migration; Place Of Birth; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Projection; Population Statistics; Research Methodology; Residence Characteristics; Residential Mobility; Sex Distribution; Sex Factors; Stable Population; Stable Population Method; Time Factors; Western Asia; census; age; age distribution; Age Reporting; Arab Countries; article; Asia; Census Methods; cultural anthropology; Cultural Background; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Estimation Technics; ethnic group; forecasting; Friends And Relatives; human relation; information processing; International Migration; Kuwait; methodology; Middle East; Migrants; migration; Place Of Birth; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; Population Projection; population research; Population Statistics; research; Research Methodology; sex difference; sex ratio; Stable Population; Stable Population Method; time; Western Asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0378679X","","","12266314","English","Popul Bull ECWA","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0020138069"

The traditional measure of efficiency of migration is shown to be inconsistent and an alternative measure has been developed. Occupations involving high skill and training requirements are, in general, found to have efficient migration patterns. The empirical findings of a positive correlation between the efficiency of migration and per capita income of homogeneous groups of workers between regions/sectors indicate that intersectoral and interoccupational income disparities within various regions in Canada can be attributable to inefficient migration patterns. © 1983.","","Americas; Automatic Data Processing; Canada; Demography; Developed Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Geography; Health Manpower; Income; Models, Theoretical; North America; Occupations; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Residential Mobility; Socioeconomic Factors; Software; Americas; Canada; Computer Programs And Programming; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Economic Factors; Geographic Factors; Human Resources; Income; Income Distribution; Information; Information Processing; Migration; Migration, Internal; Models, Theoretical; North America; Northern America; Occupations; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Socioeconomic Factors; article; Canada; computer program; Computer Programs And Programming; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; Economic Factors; economics; Geographic Factors; geography; health care manpower; Human Resources; income; Income Distribution; information; information processing; migration; Migration, Internal; North America; Northern America; occupation; population; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; socioeconomics; theoretical model; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","Cebula, The determinants of human migration, (1979); Courchene, Interprovincial migration and economic adjustment, The Canadian Journal of Economics, 3, pp. 550-576, (1970); Denton, An analysis of interregional differences in manpower utilization and earnings, staff study no. 15, (1966); Folger, Nam, Education of the American population, 1960 census monograph, (1967); Grant, Vanderkamp, The economic causes and effects of migration: Canda 1965–1971, (1976); Islam, Optimal shipment pattern and regional competitiveness on North American newsprint industry, The Journal of Economics 4, pp. 95-99, (1978); Islam, Impacts of intersectoral and occupational mobility of labour on interregional disparity in Canada, Candian Journal of Regional Science, 3, pp. 49-70, (1980); Layard, Walters, Microeconomic theory, (1978); Mart, McCready, Millerd, Canadian resource reallocation: Interprovincial labour migration, 1966–1971, Canadian Studies in Population, (1978); McNally, Highways of Canada and Northern United States of America, (1977); Schultz, Investment in human capital, American Economic Review, pp. 1-17, (1961); Schwartz, On efficiency of migration, The Journal of Human Resources, 6, pp. 193-205, (1971); Schwartz, Interpreting the effect of distance on migration, Journal of Political Economy, 81, pp. 1153-1169, (1973); Shyrock, The efficiency of internal migration in the United States, Proceedings, International Population Conference, pp. 685-694, (1959); Sjaastad, The costs and returns of human migration, Journal of Political Economy, 70, pp. 80-93, (1962); Stone, Fletcher, Migration in Canada, 1971 census of Canada profile study, Statistics Canada, catalogue number 99-705, (1973); Statistics Canada, Income distribution by sizes in Canada, (1979); Statistics Canada, Canada Year Book, (1979); Statistics Canada, Census of Canada, 5, (1976); Statistics Canada, Estimates of employees by province and industry, (1978); Todaro, A model of labour migration and urban unemployment in less developed countries, American Economic Review, 59, pp. 138-148, (1969); Vanderkamp, Interregional mobility in Canada A study of time pattern of migration, The Canadian Journal of Economics, 1, pp. 595-608, (1968); Vanderkamp, The effects of outmigration on regional employment, The Canadian Journal of Economics, 3, (1970)","","","","","","","","","01660462","","","12338957","English","Reg.

Specific study objectives were: to present some characteristics of contraceptors and noncontraceptors; to identify the major factors affecting contraceptive use; to determine the causal structure between the factors and contraceptive use; and to understand the relationship among these factors. The data collected were organized into 4 modules: socioeconomic and migration module; contraceptive prevalence and fertility module; mortality, morbidity, nutrition, and health practice module; and contraceptive continuation module. The first 3 modules were used for collecting information from all currently married women aged 15-49 years. The last module was used for collecting information from women who used some contraceptive method through the services of a family planning clinic during the 1977-82 period. Data on 2727 women were analyzed. Users and nonusers distributed differently depending on their characteristics. The characteristics selected included age, respondent's education, husband's education, working status of the respondent, age at 1st marriage, number of living children, and experience of abortion. These variables were considered to be associated with use and nonuse of contraceptives. Compared to the nonusers, the current users were slightly older in age more educated (and had husbands who were more educated), were older when 1st married, had more living children, and had more experience in abortion. Log-linear analysis was performed on 2 groups of women. Group I included all currently married women aged 15-49 years; Group II included only ""high risk"" women, i.e., currently married women aged 15-34 years, not pregnant, not in menopausal stage, and have had at least 1 live birth. Contraceptive use rates were lower in Group I than in Group II. Within both groups, the users rates differed significantly according to age, age at marriage, number of living children, education, and media exposure. There were no significant differences in contraceptive use rates according to experience of abortion and working status. The analysis on the selection of a model suggests that there were 4 independent major factors affecting the use and nonuse of contraception: number of living children, frequency of exposure to mass media, level of education, and current age. There also was a relationship among the following factors: age with number of living children and with media exposure; number of living children with level of education; and education with media exposure and with age. Although the experience of abortion did not affect contraceptive use, it was strongly associated with age. Among these 4 factors, education had the strongest effects, followed consecutively by number of living children, current age, and media exposure.","","Abortion, Induced; Age Factors; Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Birth Rate; Communication; Contraception; Contraception Behavior; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Educational Status; Employment; Family Characteristics; Family Planning; Fertility; Health Planning; Indonesia; Information Services; Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Marriage; Mass Media; Models, Theoretical; Multivariate Analysis; Organization and Administration; Parity; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research; Research Design; Sex Behavior; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Abortion, Induced; Acceptor Characteristics; Acceptors; Age Factors; Asia; Communication; Contraception; Contraceptive Usage--determinants; Currently Married; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Educational Status--men; Educational Status--women; Employment Status; Family And Household; Family Characteristics; Family Planning; Family Planning Programs; Family Size; Fertility; Fertility Control, Postconception; Fertility Measurements; Iec; Indonesia; Knowledge Sources; Macroeconomic Factors; Marriage; Marriage Age; Marriage Patterns; Mass Media; Measurement; Models, Theoretical; Multivariate Analysis; Nonacceptor Characteristics; Nonacceptors; Nuptiality; Organization And Administration; Parity; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Program Activities; Programs; Reproductive Behavior; Research Methodology; Research Report; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Southeastern Asia; Statistical Studies; Studies; nuptiality; Acceptor Characteristics; Acceptors; age; article; Asia; attitude; birth rate; contraception; Contraceptive Usage--determinants; Currently Married; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Economic Factors; economics; Educational Status--men; Educational Status--women; employment; Employment Status; Family And Household; family planning; Family Planning Programs; family size; fertility; Fertility Control, Postconception; Fertility Measurements; health care planning; Iec; Indonesia; induced abortion; information service; interpersonal communication; Knowledge Sources; Macroeconomic Factors; marriage; Marriage Age; Marriage Patterns; mass medium; measurement; methodology; multivariate analysis; Nonacceptor Characteristics; Nonacceptors; organization and management; parity; patient attitude; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; Program Activities; Programs; research; Research Methodology; Research Report; sexual behavior; social class; social status; socioeconomics; Southeast Asia; Southeastern Asia; Statistical Studies; Studies; theoretical model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01260251","","","12280177","English","Majalah Demografi Indones","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0020867320"

The years 1970, 1975 and 1979 were selected and the birth records from the civil registry provided the data. The level of fertility in the entire state was relatively low at the beginning of the decade (492 children/women). In the regions it also fluctuated around this level. Thus, the Total Fertility Level (TFL) increased from 3.49 children (Campinas) to 4.85 children (Sorocaba), although the differences in rates tended to diminish toward the end of the decade. In 1979, the TFL stabilized itself at 3.9 for the state. However, in the regions of Campinas and Ribeirao Preto, where migration was intense, the civil records show a disproportionate increase in the birthrate which is attributed to the influx of migrants. ""Rejuvenation"" in fertility reflected in the increased proportion of younger women giving birth and in the lower median age of fertility appears to indicate that in the immediate future the fertility rate will continue to decline. A change in the pattern would indicate that women apparently decided to have their children in their younger years. A study on female fertility shows that birth control was already practiced significantly in 1970 in the entire state, and a survey shows that contraceptives were used widely in urban as well as rural areas. Correlating different rates of fertility in the regions with various types of levels of development is no longer possible. The regions considered less developed are no longer at the higher end of the scale, nor are the regions with a large urban-industrial composition always on the lower end. There is a tendency for the differences between various regions to diminish respect to fertility, regardless of the various levels of the socio-dconomic development of each state.","","Age Factors; Americas; Automatic Data Processing; Behavior; Birth Rate; Brazil; Contraception Behavior; Demography; Developing Countries; English Abstract; Fertility; Geography; Health Planning; Information Services; Latin America; Organization and Administration; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Records; Research; Research Design; Sex Behavior; South America; Age Factors; Americas; Behavior; Birth Rate; Brazil; Contraceptive Usage; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; Fertility Rate; Geographic Factors; Iec; Information; Information Processing; Latin America; Measurement; Organization And Administration; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Program Activities; Programs; Records; Reproductive Behavior; Research Methodology; South America; Spatial Distribution; Total Fertility Rate; reproduction rate; spatial distribution; age; article; behavior; birth rate; Brazil; Contraceptive Usage; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; fertility; Fertility Measurements; Geographic Factors; geography; health care planning; Iec; information; information processing; information service; measurement; methodology; organization and management; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; Program Activities; Programs; research; Research Methodology; sexual behavior; South America; South and Central America; Total Fertility Rate; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01007173","","","12266141","Portuguese","Inf Demogr","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0020233985"

The program transforms quinquennial population data into annual figures and can be used in entire countries or regionally. The annual data allow year by year population projections, minimize the bias due to using larger periods and eliminate errors of interpolation, and allow results pertaining to subgroups to be analyzed. The program calls for selection of 1 or more model life tables from which it extrapolates mortality quotients by age and sex. The program gives the total for each age and sex group for the beginning of each year. Several tables of mortality by sex can be employed during the same simulation; examples of 2 such procedures are given. Calculation of general fertility rates is accomplished after entering the average number of children, mean maternal age at birth, and variance around mean maternal age. Migration is introduced by supplying the stocks of emigrants and immigrants by sex, and can be constant, variable, or proportional. The program was applied to data from Guinea in 1970, when the population was approximately 3.8 million, with high mortality, an expectation of life at birth of 42.7 for females and 39.9 for males, average family size exceeding 6, and about 55% of the population under 20 years. 2 projections were prepared, 1 assuming continued high fertility and mortality and the other lowered fertility and mortality. Differences in the projected fertility totals to 2080 do not assume importance until after 2020; the 2080 totals under the 2 assumptions are 52 million and 21.37 million. The results from Guinea exemplify the possiblities of modeling with the program and indicate the consequences of typical population dynamics.","","Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Africa, Northern; Africa, Western; Automatic Data Processing; Demography; Developing Countries; English Abstract; Forecasting; Guinea; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Software; Statistics; Africa; Africa South Of The Sahara; Computer Programs And Programming; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Estimation Technics; French Speaking Africa; Guinea; Information; Information Processing; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Projection; Research Methodology; Western Africa; Africa; Africa south of the Sahara; article; computer program; Computer Programs And Programming; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Estimation Technics; forecasting; French Speaking Africa; Guinea; information; information processing; population; population dynamics; Population Projection; research; Research Methodology; Western Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","02927616","","","12264561","French","Etud Doc Groupe Demogr Afr","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0020439621"

People move for many reasons and to many different types of destinations, the city being 1 of these. In turn, stepwise migration is an important subcomponent of the urbanward drift of people. In investigating the complex migration process in Sierra Leone and the role of the urban system within it, 2 approaches were used. The 1st technique is very general and is derived from the Nystuen and Dacey graph theory analysis of nodal regions. Instead of the maximum outflows of cities, the dominant relations among the chiefdoms of Sierra Leone were investigated in terms of the pattern of population moves. Thus, rural-rural, rural-urban, and urban-urban flows were considered simultaneously. The urban hierarchy is defined simply as a 3 tiered system comprising the capital city of Freetown as the highest level, the 12 district headquarter towns as the middle tier, and the rural areas as the lowest. If the migration pattern of Sierra Leone were simply a process of movement through an urban system, a very regular pattern of ""largest flow links"" would occur focusing upon the major towns and cities. When this pattern is compared with that resulting from a reduction of the actual flow matrix, it can be seen that there would appear to be some reason to support the contentions of the model in certain, specific parts of the country, but not in others. The 2 maps are quite dissimilar, and not even the inclusion of the 2nd largest flow for each chiefdom assists in a replication of the ""expected"" pattern. A correlation of the coincidence of vectors on the 2 maps indicates that there is no significant relationship between the actual and expected pattersn. Hence, one would tend to reject the hypothesis of the operation of a stepwise migration pattern in Sierra Leone. Yet, this conclusion has to be qualified in terms of certain conditions and for certain areas within the country. While most of the districts do not conform, some do, notably Bo, Pujehun, and Kenema. The remainder of the country fails to conform to what would be considered as conditions ideal for a stepwise pattern of movement. It appears from this cursory investigation that the stepwise model of population movement through an urban system is a viable and structurally dominant pattern of population integration only in the absence of certain deviation causing characteristics such as weak local urban focus, relative proximity to larger urban center, isolation from intermediate urban center, and other, nonurban attractive forces impinging upon the migration process. A 2nd indirect model of testing the stepwide model is through simple regression analysis. Comparison of the regression coefficients or slopes for each chiefdom with the relative proportion of the population residing in urban places yields inconclusive results.","","Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Africa, Western; Demography; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Dynamics; Regression Analysis; Research; Residential Mobility; Sierra Leone; Statistics; Africa; Africa South Of The Sahara; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; English Speaking Africa; Migration; Migration, Internal; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; Sierra Leone; Statistical Regression; Statistical Studies; Western Africa; Africa; Africa south of the Sahara; article; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; English Speaking Africa; methodology; migration; Migration, Internal; population; population dynamics; regression analysis; research; Rural-urban Migration; Sierra Leone; Statistical Regression; Statistical Studies; statistics; theoretical model; Western Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00130095","","","12266522","English","Econ Geogr","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0015360595"

This fact will have particular effects on the population distribution which are of great importance on the planning of development programs. This issue appears more complicated in Greece because of the already important social and economic inequalities between the rural and urban population which are the main cause of significant mobility. In this paper we examine the factors that could influence the mobility of the rural population in Greece using empirically tested regression models. Due to the lack of recent statistical data, we determined some values indirectly and we almost exclusively used the data from the population censuses conducted every 10 years. The basic conclusion resulting from this analysis is that the mobility of the rural population is mainly affected by the trend of individuals to work in non-agricultural sectors where work becomes more productive. Equally important is the influence of the more general trend of the population to migrate and the special characteristics of the population in some regions near the frontiers. © 1981 Martinus Nijhoff.","","Demography; Developed Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Europe; Greece; Population; Population Dynamics; Regression Analysis; Research; Residential Mobility; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Economic Factors; Europe; Greece; Mediterranean Countries; Migration; Migration, Internal; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; Socioeconomic Factors; Southern Europe; Statistical Regression; article; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; Economic Factors; economics; Europe; Greece; Mediterranean Countries; migration; Migration, Internal; population; population dynamics; regression analysis; research; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; socioeconomics; Southern Europe; Statistical Regression","","","","","","","Lowry I.S., Migration and Metropolitan Growth: Two Analytical Models, (1966); Nelson P., Migration, Real Income and Information, Journal of Regional Science, 1, (1959); Tarver J.D., Metropolitan Area Intercounty Migration Rates.

Since independence from New Zealand in 1965, the Cook Islands has gradually developed a capacity for statistics gathering in general and census taking in particular. The 1981 quinquennial census represents a watershed in the development of local personnel without the aid of external advisors; it was the 1st census to be processed within the Cook Islands by means of a computer. Both the installation of the microcomputer and the processing of the 1981 census are counted as successes. This is due to a number of factors, namely: a long period of careful planning procedures which preceded the choice of system and installation; the enthusiasm of the local staff closely involved in the planning; the emphasis on training; tests of the equipment before installation by computer practitioners with knowledge of local needs and capacities; reasonable goal setting; and the supply, with the system, of adequate spare parts tools and maintenance and training manuals. Like many island populations, that of the Cook Islands is characterized by considerable instability as illustrated by the 1981 census results. As the rate and direction of population change varies from island to island, generalizations across the nation as a whole are difficult. For example, while some of the northern atolls experienced population decline during the latest intercensal period, most had their popultion increase in 1981. All the southern islands declined during the 1976-81 period at annual rates varying from 0.6% to 3.2%. The explanation for these patterns of change lies primarily in the different rates and direction of external migration on each island, as Cook Islanders are exempt from immigration regulations to New Zealand and Australia. In recent years, women have formed a majority of the total emigration stream, affecting the sex ratio which increased from 105 in 1976 to 107 in 1981. When combined with birth registration data, the 1981 census results confirm that the fertility transition is well under way in the Cook Islands. This pattern appears to support the argument that family planning programs can bring down fertility independently of significant changes in systems of production. Nevertheless, family planning services alone cannot explain the decline in fertility; women's status has been improving and the circulation of population between the Cook Islands and New Zealand has undoubtedly helped to diffuse modern norms with respect to family size, the deliberate control of conception, and the active participation of women in reproductive decision-making. The general pattern of rapid population decline could have important consequences for the Cook Islands' economy and society and raises questions as to the economic viability of some of these small and remote island communities.","","Automatic Data Processing; Censuses; Computers; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Equipment and Supplies; Information Storage and Retrieval; Pacific Islands; Polynesia; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Program Evaluation; Research; Socioeconomic Factors; Software; Statistics; Women's Rights; Census; Computer Programs And Programming; Computers; Cook Islands; Data Analysis; Data Storage And Retrieval; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Equipment And Supplies; Family Planning Program Evaluation; Information; Information Processing; International Migration; Micronesia-polynesia; Migration; Oceania; Polynesia; Population; Population Decrease; Population Dynamics; Population Statistics; Research Methodology; Research Report; Socioeconomic Factors; Women's Status; census; apparatus, equipment and supplies; article; computer; computer program; Computer Programs And Programming; Cook Islands; data analysis; Data Storage And Retrieval; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Economic Factors; economics; Family Planning Program Evaluation; health care quality; human rights; information; information processing; information retrieval; International Migration; Micronesia-polynesia; migration; Oceania; Pacific islands; Polynesia; population; population and population related phenomena; Population Decrease; population dynamics; population research; Population Statistics; research; Research Methodology; Research Report; socioeconomics; Women's Status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","07320515","","","12265869","English","Asian Pac Cens Forum","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0020875657"

Population projections were done for China and its regions beginning in 1974 and remains a relatively new activity. Some question its validity, while others speculate about its methods and beleive only higher mathematics can be used, but this is all due to a lack of understanding of the nature of population forecasting. It is possible to predict population because if a current population situation and its changes are known, population of a particular future period can be projected e.g. for each year that is lived, a person will be 1 year older. And, population changes are primarily based on changes in births and deaths. These changes in turn are influenced by social and economic factors. Population projection is basically a forecasting of a certain period's total population, age and sex structure, the number of births and deaths, and migration. Different methods and formulas can be used to measure different population indicators, but all methods utilize comparisons. There are basically 2 methods for projecting total population: 1) the ""direct method"" regards total population as a quantity that itself changes and 2) the ""separate factor method"" breaks down total population into births, deaths, and migration. In the past, population projection has focused on the natural development of population which can be called ""uncontrolled"" because it makes ""passive measurements"" of possible population developments. In China, however, population projection is ""controlled."" Although it too measures future population developments, China's projections are not based on natural developments, but on definite population policies and estimates of results of family planning efforts.","","Age Distribution; Age Factors; Asia; Birth Rate; China; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; English Abstract; Far East; Forecasting; Mortality; Politics; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Public Policy; Research; Research Design; Sex Distribution; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistics; Age Distribution; Age Factors; Asia; Birth Rate; China; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; Estimation Technics; Fertility Measurements; Macroeconomic Factors; Measurement; Migration; Mortality; Policy; Political Factors; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Policy; Population Projection; Research Methodology; Sex Distribution; Sex Factors; Social Policy; Socioeconomic Factors; age; age distribution; article; Asia; birth rate; China; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; economics; Estimation Technics; Far East; Fertility Measurements; forecasting; Macroeconomic Factors; measurement; methodology; migration; mortality; policy; Political Factors; politics; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; Population Policy; Population Projection; research; Research Methodology; sex difference; sex ratio; socioeconomics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10006087","","","12159357","Chinese","Renkou Yanjiu","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0019031865"

Most information regarding migration is obtained from population censuses or population registers that report migration data for a given time interval. Another source of migration data is the sample survey which may be designed to provide information about both migrants and moves. Migration data produced by censuses are usually in the form of transitions. Population registers treat migration as an event and generate data on moves. A fundamental aspect of migration is its change over time. This paper aims at demonstrating how the regularities that appear in migration age compositions can be summarized in a useful manner and to suggest what such regularities may be telling us about patterns of natural increase, family relationships, and mobility levels among migrants. By disaggregating migrants into dependent and independent catagories, the paper illuminates the ways in which the age profile of migrating populations is sensitive to relative changes in dependency levels and in rates of natural increase and mobility. Just as population age compositions reflect particular characteristics of fertility and mortality regimes, so do observed migration age compositions reflect key aspects of family structure and migration patterns. Drawing on techniques used in the analysis of influence on fertility and mortality, Rogers and Castro propose procedures for adopting model migration schedules to infer migration patterns in the absence of accurate migration data. Such model migration schedules may be used to graduate inadequate data, thereby smoothing out irregularities and ascribing to the data summary measures that can be used for comparative analysis. They also may be used to interpolate to single years of age. Observed reliability of empirical migration data and indications of appropriate strategies for their correction are aided by the availability of standard families of migration schedules. Finally, such schedules may also be used to help resolve problems caused by missing data. Examples of the age-sex distribution and interstate migration are given for Mexico and Sweden; model migration proportion schedules are given for selected cities including Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City, Lagos, Greater Khartoum, Stockholm, and Kuwait.","","Age Distribution; Age Factors; Americas; Central America; Demography; Emigration and Immigration; Europe; Family Characteristics; Mexico; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Research; Residential Mobility; Scandinavia; Statistics; Sweden; Transients and Migrants; Age Distribution--determinants; Age Factors; Americas; Central America; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Estimation Technics; Europe; Family Characteristics; International Migration; Mathematical Model; Mexico; Migrants; Migration; Models, Theoretical; Natural Increase; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Residential Mobility; Scandinavia; Statistical Studies; Studies; Sweden; Western Europe; age; age distribution; Age Distribution--determinants; article; Central America; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; Estimation Technics; Europe; family size; International Migration; mathematical model; Mexico; Migrants; migration; Natural Increase; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; population growth; research; Research Methodology; Scandinavia; Statistical Studies; Studies; Sweden; theoretical model; Western Europe; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","02517604","","","12265834","English","Popul Bull UN","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0020875491"

Each sampling unit was broken up into 1500 persons which represents 300 households. It was found that the standard error increases when the size of the sampling unit diminishes. This was true both for the number of births and the number of deaths. By taking into account the cost, the weekly working time of an enumerator, the supervision and the distance within a sampling unit the author concludes that small sampling units of about 1,000 persons are more suitable for this method. Part time ""resident"" enumerators and full time ""external"" enumerators were employed in the survey. Comparison between the 2 categories shows that in order to get good registration of demographic events, the external enumerators are better off for registering the births in the urban areas and the deaths in rural areas. Resident enumerators did better at births registration in rural areas and deaths in urban areas. To insure that all households in a sampling unit are under control, each household, inhabited or uninhabited, should be numbered, and the interval between visits of the enumerator should not exceed 3 months. Strict control and permanent supervision of the enumerators is necessary to make certain that all households are visited and their members listed. In enumerating events at health centers, only those belonging to the housholds of the sampling units were recorded. Suggestions for better control include choosing supervisors from among the best enumerators with field experience and daily visits to enumerators to check questionnaires. Migration is not suitable for study using the multiple round survey because the sampling units need to be larger. Difficulties occur when comparison is made between results of different visits. For Morocco the comparison between the survey and the registration show that 71% of births were recorded during the registration against 74% during the survey, in both rural and urban areas. The recorded percentage of deaths was 62% for the registration, 57% for the survey. author's modified","","Africa; Africa, Northern; Birth Rate; Congresses; Data Collection; Demography; Developing Countries; English Abstract; Fertility; Middle East; Morocco; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research; Research Design; Sampling Studies; Statistics; Africa; Arab Countries; Conferences And Congresses; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Error Sources; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; Fertility Surveys; French Speaking Africa; Measurement; Mediterranean Countries; Morocco; Northern Africa; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Statistics; Research Methodology; Sampling Studies; Studies; Study Design; Summary Report; Survey Methodology; Surveys; Africa; Arab Countries; article; birth rate; Conferences And Congresses; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; epidemiology; Error Sources; fertility; Fertility Measurements; Fertility Surveys; French Speaking Africa; information processing; measurement; Mediterranean Countries; methodology; Middle East; Morocco; Northern Africa; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; Population Statistics; research; Research Methodology; Studies; Study Design; Summary Report; Survey Methodology; Surveys","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12264830","French","Jimlar Mutane","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0016995120"
